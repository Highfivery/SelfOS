# CLAUDE.md — SelfOS

Project rules for Claude Code. Read this every session. It is the source of truth for **how**
we build SelfOS; the **what** lives in [`docs/specs/`](docs/specs).

---

## 1. What SelfOS is

SelfOS is an **AI therapist + life coach** desktop app. It is powered by the **Claude API** and
stores everything as plain files the user owns.

### Positioning & safety (non-negotiable)

- SelfOS is a **wellness / self-help** tool. It is **NOT medical**, **NOT a medical device**, and
  **NOT a substitute for professional care**. Never describe it as therapy in the clinical sense,
  diagnosis, or treatment.
- Any feature that touches the user's wellbeing must keep this boundary visible and must route
  crisis/self-harm situations to professional resources (e.g., emergency services, crisis lines)
  rather than attempting to handle them alone. When we build conversational features, this becomes
  a hard requirement with its own spec section.
- Treat all user content as **highly sensitive personal data**. It never leaves the device except
  in explicit Claude API calls the user has consented to. The API key lives **only** in the
  Electron main process and is never logged, committed, or exposed to the renderer.
- **Never tell users an owner/admin can see their data.** No user-facing copy — to answerers/recipients
  **or** to authors — may state that a household owner or administrator can access someone's answers/content
  (durable product rule, 2026-06-15: the questionnaire `discloseAdminAccess` setting + admin-access
  disclosure line were removed for this reason). The owner's full-access reality (RBAC at the app layer) is
  real, but we do not surface it as a disclosure that could make people feel surveilled.

Defer voice/interaction modality, but never make an architectural choice that precludes it.

## 3. Architecture principles

1. **Feature-module registry.** Each feature is a self-contained module that _registers_ what it
   contributes (nav entry, routes, settings, data schemas). The app shell knows nothing about
   specific features — adding a feature is adding a module, not editing the shell.
2. **Schema-driven everything.** Settings (and content types) are declared as typed, Zod-backed
   definitions; UI and persistence derive from the declaration. Add a setting = add one declaration.
3. **Vault is the only storage.** All file I/O goes through the main-process vault service: atomic
   writes (temp-file + rename), file-watching, sync-conflict detection, per-format schema
   validation + migration. The renderer never touches `fs`.
4. **Hard process boundaries.** `contextIsolation: true`, `sandbox: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`,
   strict CSP, no remote module. Renderer ↔ main only through a **typed IPC layer** (contextBridge
   preload + typed channel contracts). Secrets and network access stay in main.
5. **DRY, typed seams.** Shared types/schemas live in one place and are imported across
   main/preload/renderer. No duplicated shapes; no `any`.

> These are summarized here; the authoritative detail is [`docs/specs/00-architecture.md`](docs/specs/00-architecture.md).

---

## 4. Coding standards

- **TypeScript strict**, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. No `any`; prefer
  `unknown` + narrowing. No non-null `!` to silence the compiler — fix the type.
- **Zod first.** Define a Zod schema, then `z.infer` the type. Validate at every boundary (files,
  IPC, Claude API responses).
- **Named exports** only (no default exports). **One component per file.** Co-locate
  `Component.module.css` next to `Component.tsx`.
- **No magic values.** Colors, spacing, etc. come from design tokens — never hard-coded.
- **Errors are typed and handled**, never swallowed. User-facing failures degrade gracefully.
- **Accessibility is not optional** — semantic HTML, keyboard support, visible focus, sufficient
  contrast.
- Match the style of surrounding code. Keep modules small and cohesive.

---

## 5. Spec-driven workflow

**No feature code without an approved spec in `docs/specs/`.** The spec is written first, reviewed,
and perfected; then code follows it. If implementation reveals the spec is wrong, update the spec in
the same change (see Living docs).

Specs are numbered and inherit [`docs/specs/_TEMPLATE.md`](docs/specs/_TEMPLATE.md).

---

## 6. How we work — the methodical cadence

We move **slowly and deliberately**, perfecting one slice before starting the next.

For every slice (the **PR-based flow** — `main` only ever moves through a merged PR):

1. **Branch** off the latest `main` — `git switch main && git pull` first, then
   `git switch -c <type>/<slug>` (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…`, `docs/…`, `refactor/…`). **Never commit
   to `main` directly, and never `git merge origin/main` into a branch — rebase onto it** (`git rebase
origin/main`) so history stays linear and the release manifest never carries a stale value forward.
2. **Spec** → review with the user → perfect → approve.
3. **Implement** with tests (see Definition of Done).
4. Run the **`ship-slice`** skill: `quality-gate` → `code-reviewer` agent → `sync-docs` → commit (on the
   branch).
5. **Push the branch and open a PR** (`git push -u origin HEAD && gh pr create`). Let **CI go green**.
6. **Squash-merge the PR on GitHub** with a Conventional Commit title (`gh pr merge --squash`); delete the
   branch. One clean commit lands on `main` — never a direct push, never a local merge.
7. **Offer to release** (the **`release`** skill): once the slice is on `main`, ask the user
   _"Tag & publish vX.Y.Z now, or batch with the next change?"_ Releasing = **merging the open
   release-please PR** (which auto-bumps the version, writes `CHANGELOG.md`, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and builds +
   publishes the `.dmg`). **Never hand-bump a version or hand-tag** — release-please owns it (spec
   [`19`](docs/specs/19-distribution.md)).

**ALWAYS ask — NEVER assume or guess.** Before implementing anything with an unstated product, UX,
visibility, permission, or behavior decision (defaults, who-sees-what, scope, placement, period),
**stop and ask detailed clarifying questions** (`AskUserQuestion`). Do not fill gaps with your own
defaults. The user has stated this forcefully and repeatedly; guessing has produced rework. Only
proceed without asking when the choice is genuinely unambiguous from the request or already answered.

**NEVER fix a bug whose cause you have only ASSUMED — diagnose the real root cause FIRST, then fix.**
(2026-06-16, after a costly violation.) When something fails, do NOT pattern-match to a plausible cause and
start changing code — **reproduce/verify the actual cause against the real system before touching anything.**
Specifically:

- **Never assume a Claude/model failure is a content-policy refusal.** "No output / unparseable" is far more
  often a mechanical cause — **token-budget starvation (adaptive `thinking` shares `max_tokens` → truncated/
  empty output), truncation, a parse/validation drop, a wrong model, a transport error**. A real example cost
  the user a lot of tokens: I assumed intimacy generation was a refusal and rewrote the prompt to a weaker
  "wellness" register — the real bug was the thinking budget; the prompt was fine and my change was reverted.
- **The offline fakes (`SELFOS_FAKE_CLAUDE`, etc.) HIDE this class of bug** — they always return canned valid
  output, so every test passes while the live app fails. When a model call fails only in the real app,
  **diagnose against the LIVE model** (reconstruct the exact prompt from the real builders, call the API, read
  `stop_reason` + the raw text) BEFORE changing the prompt or anything else.
- If you cannot verify the cause yourself, **say so and ask** — do not ship a speculative fix. A fix premised
  on an unverified guess is a guess.
- See memory [[adaptive-thinking-shares-maxtokens]] and [[always-ask-never-assume]].

## 7. Definition of Done

A slice is **not** done until **all** of these pass:

- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` clean
- [ ] `pnpm lint` clean (ESLint) and Prettier-formatted
- [ ] Unit/component tests for new logic (Vitest); meaningful, not trivial
- [ ] E2E tests for **every** new user-facing surface/section, not just the happy path (Playwright).
      **ALWAYS WRITE _AND RUN_ THE E2E — never defer it as "pending on-machine verification" or skip it on a
      worktree/"needs a display" excuse (2026-06-24, forceful).** E2E runs headlessly here: `pnpm --filter
@selfos/desktop exec electron-vite build` once, then `pnpm exec playwright test [-g "<name>"]` — the
      `_electron.launch` harness needs no visible display. A slice is NOT done until its E2E is green.
      Include a no-horizontal-overflow / layout guard for content-heavy screens, and a geometry guard
      for fixed-size controls (e.g. a toggle must not shrink in a flex row — assert computed
      `flex-shrink` / thumb position). **The overflow guard must catch INNER scrollbars too** — assert NO
      element has `scrollWidth > clientWidth` with computed `overflow-x: auto|scroll` (not just `main`);
      and test at the **actual rendered container widths** (e.g. the narrow Sessions sidebar, ~240px),
      not only the 390px page width — a `main`-only check missed a scrolling filter + a clipped sidebar.
      **Assert the FULL surface renders to the bottom — not just "no overflow".** For any content
      form/section, scroll to the end and assert the LAST element actually shows: every question is visible
      (no input hidden in a default-collapsed accordion — assert no `<details>` is `!open`), and the trailing
      affordances (e.g. the onboarding "Tell me more" go-deeper + Continue/Skip) are visible. A passing
      overflow guard does **not** prove the content is present — a collapsed accordion silently swallowed the
      last group's questions and every prior check (overflow, screenshots of the top) missed it.
- [ ] **Docs in lockstep** — relevant spec / `CLAUDE.md` / skills updated (`sync-docs`)
- [ ] **Self code-review** passed (`code-reviewer` agent); findings fixed or explicitly accepted
- [ ] Accessibility check for any UI
- [ ] **Responsive** — every UI works and looks intentional from ~360px (phone) to desktop; include a
      mobile-width layout guard (see §12). **AND: the screen FILLS the available width — the top-level
      content container has NO `max-width` cap (only dialogs/overlays, ellipsizing text, and fixed-aspect
      charts may cap; chat bubbles may use a % — never a fixed px page cap). Verify at desktop width, not
      just 360px.** (§12 durable rule.)
- [ ] **Visual QA pass (not just functional)** — screenshot every touched/new surface and look
      critically: alignment (buttons bottom-aligned with the inputs beside them, not floating
      mid-height), even spacing/rhythm, nothing clipped, and each element looks intentional and
      cohesive with its neighbours. Fix bad-looking UI before it ships — don't rely on "the test
      passed" (see §12).
- [ ] **Whole-flow coherence walk (not just "tests pass")** — actually walk the COMPLETE user flow
      end-to-end (the real app / preview, every step in order) and judge whether it **makes sense as a
      whole**, not just that each screen works. Specifically hunt for: **the same thing asked/picked more
      than once** (e.g. selecting a person at creation AND again in a sub-panel AND at send), **labels that
      collide or confuse** across steps (two different controls that read like the same question), **dead or
      now-redundant controls** left behind by a model change, and steps that no longer belong. A green E2E
      suite proves each step _functions_ — it does **not** prove the flow is coherent or non-redundant. When a
      change alters a flow's shape (e.g. moving recipient selection to the front), **re-walk every screen that
      touched that concept** and reconcile it. (2026-06-16: after recipient-selection moved to a start step, a
      stale "About a specific person?" picker in the AI panel still re-asked who it's for — caught by the user,
      not by the passing tests.)
- [ ] **Content-correctness check for personalized/generated content (not just "it rendered")** — when a
      surface shows content tailored to a specific viewer (a compatibility variant, a per-person prompt, a
      generated question), **assert the CONTENT is correct for that viewer**, not merely that the screen
      renders. Decrypt/inspect the actual text. (2026-06-16: a compatibility recipient was asked questions
      about THEMSELVES instead of the OTHER participant — every screen functioned, the suite was green, but the
      content was wrong; the offline fake returned canned output that hid it. The fakes now echo the
      `aboutName`, and the test asserts the recipient's variant names the OTHER person, not themselves.)
- [ ] **Test the feature when its PREREQUISITE is ABSENT (the common real state), not just the happy path** —
      if a feature only works once something is set up (a relay connected, a key added, AI enabled, a person
      granted access), write a test for the **not-set-up** path too: assert the graceful fallback AND that the
      UI tells the user how to enable it (it must never be silently invisible). (2026-06-16: the unified-relay
      link only mints with a connected relay; the happy-path E2E connected one first, so it never caught that —
      with no relay — the link feature was completely silent. The user sent a household questionnaire, saw no
      link, no explanation. Now the send panel hints "connect a relay in Settings → Relay," with a test.)
- [ ] **Drive the COMPLETE user-facing flow through the actual UI — never let a bridge-only test stand in for a
      missing screen.** For any feature with a multi-step lifecycle (create → see its state → act on it →
      delete), the E2E must walk **every step through the rendered UI**: the control that triggers each step
      must be **present, reachable, and clicked** — not invoked by calling `window.selfos.*`/the bridge directly.
      A coreBridge/integration test that drives the backend proves the _backend_ works; it says **nothing** about
      whether the button that calls it exists. (2026-06-16: a household relay link could be drained by a
      coreBridge test that called `assignmentsDrain()` directly — green — while the Results UI gated the "Check
      for responses" button on `channel === 'relay'`, so for a household send the button **never rendered** and
      the response was unretrievable. The user hit a dead end the passing suite couldn't see. Also surface state
      the user relies on: after an action (send), the entity's state must be **visibly reflected** where they
      look next — a "Sent · <date>" badge in the list + builder, not a form that looks untouched. Bridge tests
      complement UI walks; they do not replace them.)
- [ ] **`/gallery` updated** when a design-system primitive is added or changed (it must showcase all of them)
- [ ] **Admin-only UI is marked** — any control/section visible only to an Owner / super-admin carries a
      consistent "admin only" indicator (see §12)
- [ ] **The Questionnaires E2E matrix is extended** — any **new questionnaire option** (answer type,
      questionnaire type, sensitivity tier, privacy/visibility mode, delivery channel, capability gate, …) must
      add an end-to-end case to the standing §16.7 matrix in `08-questionnaires.md` (the regression suite a
      whole-feature mismatch once slipped past). Not "happy path only" — decrypt the vault to assert data.
- [ ] **A change to questionnaire SENDING/DELIVERY is verified across EVERY type × recipient × relay-state —
      not one path.** A send goes out through more than one code path: **one-person** (`assignmentsCreate`) AND
      **compatibility** (`assignmentsCreateCompatibility`), each to a **household** OR **external** recipient,
      each **with** a relay connected OR **without** one. Fixing/testing ONE path (e.g. one-person household
      with a relay) says NOTHING about the others — the user tests the path you didn't. For any delivery change,
      run E2E for **all** of: one-person household (relay → link + Email/Text delivery; no relay → the
      "connect a relay" hint, never silent), one-person external, compatibility household (relay), compatibility
      external; assert the **link + the Email/Text/Copy delivery actually render** (or the hint), and that a
      mint failure **surfaces** (never a silent Inbox-only fallback). (2026-06-17: a household COMPATIBILITY
      send minted no link + showed no hint — the unified-delivery work was wired only into `assignmentsCreate`,
      and the compat path's `catch` silently swallowed the failure; verifying compat-with-a-relay live would
      have caught it. Twice the user hit "no link" on a path the tests never drove.)
- [ ] **Conventional Commit** on a feature branch

The `quality-gate` skill runs the automatable subset. The git hooks
(`.husky/pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, `pre-push`) and CI enforce the hard gates so they can't be
bypassed.

---

## 8. Living docs & the feedback loop (keep everything up to date)

Docs, rules, and skills must always match reality. Two loops:

- **Reactive — when the user gives feedback or a durable preference:** use the **`capture-feedback`**
  skill to persist it to the right place (this file, a skill, settings, or a spec) and append a dated
  entry to the Changelog below. Don't just remember it for the session — write it down.
- **Proactive — after any change in behavior:** use the **`sync-docs`** skill (backed by the
  `doc-auditor` agent) to detect drift between code and `docs/specs/` / `CLAUDE.md` / skills, and
  propose the concrete edits. The `pre-commit` doc-drift warning is the deterministic backstop.

If you notice a rule here is stale or contradicted by how we actually work, **propose updating it**.

---

## 9. Git & commit standards

- **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`,
  `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, `revert:`). Enforced by commitlint; body lines ≤ 100 chars. The squash-merge
  **PR title** is what lands on `main`, so it must be a valid Conventional Commit (it drives the changelog +
  the version bump). `feat:` → minor, `fix:` → patch, `feat!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE` → major (pre-1.0: breaking →
  minor); `docs:`/`chore:`/`test:`/`ci:`/`build:` don't cut a release.
- Every commit ends with the trailer:
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- **Branches → PRs → squash-merge.** Work on a `<type>/<slug>` branch off `main`; land it by **squash-merging
  a PR on GitHub** (§6). **`main` is never pushed to directly and is never updated by a local merge.** **Never
  `git merge origin/main` into a branch — rebase onto it** (a hand-merge once carried a stale release manifest
  forward and looped release-please). The **`commit`** skill writes compliant messages and refuses if the
  quality gate hasn't passed.
- **Versioning, tags, and `CHANGELOG.md` are owned by release-please — never hand-edit them.** Don't bump a
  `version`, don't `git tag`, don't write `CHANGELOG.md` by hand, and **never add a `Release-As:` commit** (the
  footer lingers in history and forces backward version proposals). `.release-please-manifest.json` is the
  source-of-truth current version and **must match the latest git tag**; a `bootstrap-sha` floor keeps the
  commit scan above old release-config commits. If it drifts (a release-PR loop), fix the manifest to the
  latest tag — see spec [`19`](docs/specs/19-distribution.md) §7 + the **`release`** skill.
- **Git hooks need Node ≥ 20** (`.nvmrc` pins **24**). If a push/commit fails with a `pnpm requires … Node`
  error, run `nvm use` first. The hooks fail fast with this hint.

## 10. Commands

```bash
pnpm install        # install deps + set up git hooks (husky)
pnpm lint           # ESLint across the monorepo
pnpm lint:fix       # ESLint --fix
pnpm format         # Prettier write
pnpm format:check   # Prettier check
pnpm typecheck      # TypeScript per-package (--if-present)
pnpm test           # Vitest unit/component (delegates to each package)
pnpm test:watch     # Vitest watch

# Desktop app (apps/desktop)
pnpm --filter @selfos/desktop dev     # electron-vite dev (HMR)
pnpm --filter @selfos/desktop build   # build main/preload/renderer to out/
pnpm --filter @selfos/desktop e2e     # build, then Playwright-Electron E2E
pnpm --filter @selfos/desktop release:build  # electron-builder --mac --publish always (manual release build)
```

Tests are **per-package** (`pnpm -r test`): the desktop app runs Vitest with a jsdom environment for
component tests. E2E (Playwright + Electron) runs on demand / in CI, not on every push (it builds the
app first).

**Releases are automated** (spec [`19-distribution`](docs/specs/19-distribution.md)): merged Conventional
Commits drive **release-please** → a "Release vX.Y.Z" PR → on merge it bumps the version, writes the root
`CHANGELOG.md`, and creates a draft GitHub Release; a macOS Actions job builds + attaches the `.dmg`, then
publishes it. Maintainers never hand-edit a version or tag. macOS-only + unsigned for now.

## 11. Skills & agents available

**Skills** (`.claude/skills/`): `write-spec`, `quality-gate`, `capture-feedback`, `sync-docs`,
`commit`, `ship-slice`, `release`. (`add-setting` and `new-feature-module` are added once the settings
registry and feature-module architecture are built.)

**Agents** (`.claude/agents/`): `code-reviewer`, `test-author`, `spec-writer`, `doc-auditor`.

---

## 12. UI/UX principles (non-negotiable)

Every UI change is designed **as part of the whole** — sleek, modern, and intentional. Nothing should
look bolted-on or like an afterthought; consider the overall layout and likely future additions before
placing anything. Specifically:

- **Responsive, one codebase.** SelfOS is a single responsive app (no separate mobile UI). Every screen
  must look and work great from ~360px (phone) to desktop, adapting purely by screen size. Treat this
  like accessibility — always. (Electron is desktop-only; the iPhone path is **Capacitor** — see the
  platform memory and the Capacitor track.)
- **Content FILLS the available width — NEVER cap a page/content container with `max-width` (durable
  rule, the user has flagged this repeatedly and forcefully).** The content area (right of the sidebar)
  is the canvas; every route's top-level container must FILL it (`width: 100%`, no cap). **Do NOT** put
  `max-width` + `margin: 0 auto` on a route's page/content wrapper — that centers a narrow column and
  wastes the horizontal space, and it is a recurring UX failure. The screens are laid out with grids/
  flex that use the full width; a fixed reading-width cap is wrong for this app. **The ONLY things that
  may cap width:** (a) a **modal/overlay dialog** (centered + capped, e.g. `max-width: 460px`), (b) text
  that **ellipsizes** (a truncation cap on a label/chip), (c) a **fixed-aspect visualization** (a chart).
  A chat/message **bubble** may use a **percentage** (~80%) for readability — never a fixed `px` cap.
  When you build OR review ANY screen, confirm the top-level content container has **no `max-width`**;
  when in doubt, fill. (2026-07-11: removed content caps on Together/Settings/Home/Questionnaires/You/
  Onboarding/Gallery after the user flagged it yet again.)
- **Admin-only visibility marker.** Anything visible **only** to an Owner / super-admin (cost, budgets,
  the Everyone scope + person picker + by-person breakdown, the Roles screen, etc.) carries a clear,
  consistent indicator (e.g. a small "Admin only" / lock badge) so admins know normal users don't see
  it. Apply to **all** current and future admin-gated UI.
- **Global controls live in the `TopBar`** (a slot-based header): the usage ring, the appearance
  (light/dark) toggle, logout, and future global items — integrated seamlessly, not as separate add-ons.
- **`/gallery` is the living component catalog** — update it whenever a design-system primitive is
  added or changed (DoD item).
- **No scaffolding for unbuilt features.** Don't pre-create capabilities/schemas/settings/routes for
  features that aren't specced and built (see the "never assume" rule in §6).
- **Visual QA is part of testing.** When testing a change, scrutinize the rendered UI for alignment,
  spacing, vertical rhythm, and polish — not only "does it work." Screenshot every touched surface and
  look critically (e.g. buttons must bottom-align with the labelled fields beside them, not float
  mid-height). Catch bad-looking UI before the user does. (DoD §7.)
- **NO horizontal scrollbars — anywhere, ever.** Not page-level and **not inner controls**. A filter row,
  toolbar, tab strip, or `SegmentedControl` that scrolls-x to fit is a UX failure. Test it (see §7).
- **Don't solve "it doesn't fit" by WRAPPING — wrapping a control row is lazy, not a design.** When options
  don't fit a narrow pane, pick a **space-filling component**, not a wrapping pile of chips: a full-width
  `Select` for a status filter, a full-width control, or a genuinely compact control — something that fills
  the space and scales to any label length. (The Sessions status filter is a full-width `Select`, not chips;
  catalog cards fill the row via an `auto-fit` grid.) Reserve wrapping for genuinely free-flowing content
  (tags on a detail page), never for a primary control cluster.
- **Design for density — cards must not waste vertical space.** A long catalog of cards must be compact and
  scannable: tight padding, clamp blurbs (`-webkit-line-clamp`), fold secondary metadata onto one line, and
  use a denser `auto-fit` grid so more fit per row. Don't ship tall, sparse cards (the guided-session cards
  were 5 lines tall → compacted to ~3 with a clamped blurb + an eyebrow that carries the tag + a "Steps"
  marker on one line).
- **Cards & rows: never let a title fight a tag/badge for the same line.** A title + framework tag on one
  line wraps the title a word-per-line at narrow widths — ugly. Put the tag as an **eyebrow above** the
  title (or below); give the title the full width. Likewise, don't cram many controls into one narrow row —
  collapse secondary actions (rename/delete) into a **kebab menu** rather than a wrapping icon cluster.
- **Flex truncation:** any text in a flex row that should ellipsize needs `min-width: 0` on the flex item
  (and the container) or it overflows its pane — the classic flexbox footgun. Verify narrow panes don't
  overflow.
- **Dropdown menus must not be clipped** by an `overflow: auto/scroll` ancestor, and a right-aligned menu
  must not render off-screen — pin its trigger so the menu stays in view (don't let the trigger wrap to a
  left-aligned line under a `right: 0` menu).
- **Collapsible/accordion** content needs clear spacing between the summary and its body when open (never
  let the first item butt up against the title). **Never default-COLLAPSE form inputs** — accordion grouping
  on a form/intake is for optional tidying only, so every group renders **open by default** (still
  user-collapsible). A group collapsed by default silently hides the questions inside it at the bottom of a
  section, so a person never sees or answers them (the onboarding "Your circle" group hid four questions; the
  shared `@selfos/answering` form now opens all groups). Grouped-content forms get the §7 "full surface
  renders to the bottom" E2E guard.
- **Realtime progress for EVERY AI generation (non-negotiable, the user has demanded this repeatedly and
  angrily).** Any time AI generates ANYTHING the user waits on — images (cover/illustration/dream/vision),
  text, chapters, analysis, dream synthesis, questionnaires — the UI MUST show **realtime progress**: a live
  **phase** label of what's happening now, an **elapsed timer**, an **estimated time / ETA**, and a
  determinate-or-phased affordance. A bare spinner, a "Working…" pill, or a static "Creating…" line is
  UNACCEPTABLE (it reads as broken). Mirror the `story:progress` streaming pattern (bridge `emit*Progress`
  event bound for the whole op → preload sub → renderer `DraftProgress`-style component with phase + timer +
  ETA), subscribe at APP level so it survives navigation, and show a global indicator for background work.
  Wire progress at the SAME time you add the AI call — never a follow-up. (See the memory
  `ai-generation-realtime-progress`.)
- **Surface a control WHERE the work happens, not only buried in Settings.** A control the user needs while
  doing a task must be visible on the page where the task happens. Settings may hold the source-of-truth
  setting (one synced value), but ALSO surface that same control (reading/writing the SAME setting — single
  source of truth) inline where it's used (e.g. the global image style on the Your Story overview + the dream
  panel, next to the generate actions), preferably as a compact inline affordance. (2026-07-16, forceful.)
- **"Improve" means redesign, not relocate.** When asked to improve or move a component, actually
  redesign it for its new context — fit, density, space-conservation, cohesion with neighbours — don't
  just move the existing component. (E.g. the appearance control became a compact icon→popover in the
  TopBar, not the old wide segmented control; the brand mark sits in an app-icon tile, not a loose glyph.)

## Changelog

A running log of durable decisions and feedback captured into the project config. Newest first.

- 2026-07-20 — **Fix (Pulse tab chart layout — the big empty white space; user-reported with a screenshot; SPEC
  58 §3.2a; on `fix/pulse-chart-layout`).** The user: the two Pulse trend cards ("Your check-ins" / "From your
  sessions") had large empty white space that "doesn't look good," but explicitly did NOT want the charts to
  span 100% wide ("they'd be too big"). **Root cause (from the code, not assumed):** `LineChart` is deliberately
  capped at `max-width: 440px` (a fixed-aspect chart at `width:100%` in a wide container scales to an enormous
  height — that's the "too big" the user intuited), but each chart sat ALONE in a full-width card, so the 440px
  chart floated left and ~900px of the card was empty. **Fix:** the two trend cards now lay out in a centered,
  width-capped grid — `.pulseCharts { grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 540px));
justify-content: center }` — so two cards sit side by side filling the width, and (the case my first QA
  caught) a LONE card is a bounded, centered chart rather than a narrow chart adrift in a wide card. `LineChart`
  gained an optional `maxWidth` prop (default keeps the 440 cap for questionnaire/Memory trends unchanged) so
  the dashboard column can raise it; Pulse passes 600 (the 540 grid track is the real cap). **Visual-QA caught
  the real problem the CSS math alone would've missed:** my first attempt used `1fr` columns, which STRETCH a
  lone card full-width — the screenshot showed the single-chart case (a couple with no session wrap-ups yet, a
  common early state) still had a huge empty right; capping the track + centering fixed it, verified at 1440/
  1000/700px. **Lessons: (1) a fixed-aspect chart fundamentally can't fill a wide row without becoming too tall
  — so "remove the empty space" means bounding the chart's width and CENTERING it (balanced, intentional), not
  stretching it; capping a chart's width is the §12 chart exception and exactly what "don't make them span the
  full width" asks for. (2) An `auto-fit minmax(_, 1fr)` grid fills beautifully for N≥2 items but stretches a
  lone item full-width — cap the track (`minmax(_, 540px)`) + `justify-content: center` so the single-item case
  is bounded, and always screenshot the 1-item state, not just the happy 2-item one.**
- 2026-07-20 — **Build (Together home REDESIGNED into a 4-tab surface + the challenge-checkin deferral fixed;
  SPEC 58 §3.2a + SPEC 52 §3.3; two PRs — the follow-up #279 (merged) then `feat/together-tabs-ia`).** The user:
  the Together page had grown busy and hard to scan (7 stacked sections — hero · Pulse · sessions board · an
  8-card guided catalog with **unclamped** blurbs · joint challenges · Desire & intimacy · crisis footer), and
  asked to redesign it, "maybe tabs". **Process: mockup-first, and the FIRST mockup was broken** — I built it in
  JS and delivered it into a context that renders only STATIC snapshots, so the script never ran and the user saw
  an empty shell (they rightly called it out). Rebuilt it **pure-CSS/HTML** (radio-driven switching, no JS) so it
  works as a static snapshot, validated it (balanced tags, every control wired, no `<script>`), and showed three
  IA options (3-tab / 4-tab / no-tabs collapse). **Decisions locked (AskUserQuestion):** the user chose **4 tabs**
  (Sessions · Practices · Pulse · Desire); then two sub-forks — **the Desire tab appears ONLY once BOTH partners
  enable adult content** (a stricter privacy posture than the old always-shown "Desire & intimacy" heading — the
  §1 "never make anyone feel surveilled" call), and **joint challenges live on the Sessions tab** ("what's active
  between you"). **Built:** a `together/*` splat route (deep-linkable, reload-surviving) with the tab active-state
  mirrored to `useState` (the Your Story pattern, so it also works rendered bare in RTL); the Questionnaires
  `role="tablist"` + roving-tabindex a11y; a **"Due" badge on the Pulse tab** (reusing `pulseIsDue`, now extracted
  to a shared `pulseDue.ts` so Home + Together share one definition — DRY). To badge the Pulse tab and gate the
  Desire tab, the parent (`Together.tsx`) now **owns** the YNM status + Pulse view: `TogetherPulse` and
  `TogetherIntimacy` became **controlled** (the intimacy panel split into a `variant='unlock'` affordance at the
  bottom of Practices pre-eligibility and a `variant='panel'` full panel on the Desire tab). **The catalog blurbs
  now clamp to 2 lines** in a denser `auto-fill minmax(240px)` grid — the single biggest scroll-length win (§12
  density). The hero + crisis footer stay outside the tabs, present on every tab (§8.2). **The follow-up shipped
  FIRST as its own PR (#279, merged):** `ChallengeCard` deferred its check-in row whenever a check-in was due, but
  the "For you" band it deferred to is itself suppressed under proactivity-off/crisis/new-person/dismissal — so a
  due check-in could be left with no inline action. Home now passes `checkInHandledElsewhere` (computed from
  whether the `challenge-checkin` recommendation actually survived ranking), and the card defers only then. (That
  fix is entirely on `main`; the tabs PR's only Home change is the `pulseDue` import swap.) **Gate green:**
  typecheck, lint, format, **1381 desktop** unit (+`togetherTabs`/`pulseDue` pure helpers, +4 tab-IA RTL, +the
  controlled-component test refactors, +the ChallengeCard suppressed-band branch), **20 Together E2E** (incl. a
  new tab-IA walk: 3 tabs while Desire is locked, catalog behind Practices, deep-link + **reload survives** the
  tab, 360px overflow guard). Real-Electron visual QA at desktop (clean 3-tab strip, "Due" badge, the Practices
  grid with clamped blurbs) + 360px. **Lessons: (1) a mockup is only useful if it RENDERS where you send it — a
  JS-driven page becomes an empty shell in a static-snapshot pane; build approval mockups pure-CSS/HTML (radio/
  `:checked` switching) so they work anywhere, and verify before sending. (2) A tab strip must FIT at 360px (§12):
  4 text tabs overran by ~23px, so the ≤480px rule tightens padding + shrinks the count badges — the
  `overflow-x:auto` is then truly inert, and the E2E inner-scroller guard is what proved it (measured `sw`/`cw` to
  find the exact overrun rather than guessing). (3) To badge/gate a tab from state a child owns, LIFT that state
  to the parent and make the child controlled — the parent needs the YNM status even when the Desire panel isn't
  mounted, and owning the Pulse view avoids a second fetch that would drift after a check-in. (4) A splat-route
  tab must mirror the route param into `useState` (the Story pattern) or it breaks in RTL, where the component is
  rendered without the matching Route so `useParams` never updates.**
- 2026-07-20 — **Build (the Together "Joint challenge" tile becomes ACTIONABLE — plus the dead-end it pointed
  at; SPEC 58 §5.6 + SPEC 52 §3.3 amended; on `feat/joint-challenge-actions`, PR pending).** The user: the
  joint-challenge card on the Together dashboard "should have an action the user can click to log/complete,"
  and asked for a review of the workflow. **Reviewed first, and the review found worse than a missing button:**
  the tile was display-only by design (58 §5.6 deliberately routed check-in to "each partner's own Home card"),
  but its subtitle "Track your own check-in on Home" was a **dead end** — 60 §3.1.5 had reduced Home's
  `ChallengeCard` to a passive navigate, so the only real actions lived a THIRD hop away in the Sessions
  `ChallengeSection`. The journey was Together → Home → Sessions with the first instruction factually wrong (a
  §7 whole-flow-coherence failure), and it contradicted the durable §12 rule (surface the control WHERE the
  work happens). **All 5 forks asked first (AskUserQuestion):** one-tap-then-expand · name whose turn it is ·
  keep closed ones in a collapsed group · make Home actionable too · and — surfaced only after tracing the code
  — how the Home card and the "For you" `challenge-checkin` recommendation should divide the job, since both
  would otherwise render the same buttons once a check-in is due (chose: the card defers while due). **The key
  design finding: NO schema, IPC, or bridge change was needed.** `JointChallengeStatus` is a pure cross-partner
  aggregate that discards which twin is yours — but it carries `groupId`, and `challengeStore` already holds the
  viewer's OWN challenges, so the twin is matchable **client-side** and acted on through the existing
  person-scoped `challenges:checkIn`/`snooze`/`setStatus`. The partner's state is DERIVED
  (`checkedInCount − (mine ? 1 : 0)`). **That makes the §8 privacy boundary structural, not conventional:** the
  aggregate comes from the gated bridge read, the viewer's record from their own store, and a partner's
  `reflection`/`outcome` text never reaches the renderer — only a count ever crosses (code-reviewer verified
  this adversarially and confirmed it airtight, including that `action` is coach-authored on both twins with no
  user edit path). **Three real bugs surfaced during the build, each caught by a gate rather than assumed:**
  (1) the E2E caught that gating the store refresh on `if (!loaded)` left a **stale-but-loaded empty list** —
  Home loads the store at boot, so a twin minted later in a session produced NO check-in button at all (fixed
  by refreshing on mount unconditionally); (2) the RTL suite was passing on a **race** (the mock's default
  `challengesList: []` wiped the seeded twin after the assertion ran) — the bridge and the seed now agree; and
  (3) the code-reviewer caught that the new "Let it go" action created a **zombie row**: both twins `abandoned`
  is `active:false, allCheckedIn:false`, which the `active || !allCheckedIn` split stranded in the OPEN list
  forever with no live twin (so no buttons, no way to clear it) — and the SAME predicate in core's
  `jointChallengeGroundingLines` kept feeding it to the couples coach as a live commitment. Both now key on
  **`active` alone**, and a closed row reports its own ending ("You both did it" / "Let go"). Also applied from
  the review: check-in failures are **surfaced with the typed note preserved** (`challengeStore.checkIn` now
  returns its result instead of discarding it — a silent loss of a reflection the person believes they saved is
  the worst outcome here), busy-guards on both surfaces, and a §12 `wrap` fix on the collapsed row (the pill
  carries an **unbounded** partner display name). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1553 core + 1370
  desktop** unit, E2E (the H2 walk extended into a two-persona decrypt-level flow: named state → one-tap
  check-in → decrypt asserts it hit Ben's OWN twin → partner's turn → both done → closed group). **Lessons:
  (1) "add a button" is worth reviewing as a FLOW — the missing action was real, but the copy pointing at a
  surface that couldn't perform it was the worse bug, and only a whole-flow walk finds that. (2) A guard that
  short-circuits on `loaded` is wrong whenever the data can change AFTER the first load — `loaded` means
  "fetched once", never "fresh". (3) An RTL test that seeds a store the component also refetches passes on a
  RACE unless the mock bridge serves the same records. (4) A new terminal action (let-it-go) can reach a state
  the list-splitting predicate never anticipated — and if a core grounding filter shares that predicate, the
  coach silently inherits the bug too; move BOTH the E2E overflow guard and the reasoning onto the state the
  new action actually creates (the guard was verified to FAIL without the `wrap` fix, so it proves something).**
- 2026-07-20 — **Build + durable owner decision (AI chat reliability, message management & dream-analysis
  coherence; SPEC 66 written + BUILT, all 5 slices; on `feat/chat-reliability-and-rewind`, PR pending).** The
  user reported AI replies "getting cut off or incomplete" with no recovery, no way to regenerate or delete/go
  back through messages, and the dream coach producing TWO analyses. Traced rather than pattern-matched.
  **Root cause of the cut-offs (verified, not assumed): `ClaudeStreamResult` was `{ text, usage }` — it carried
  NO `stop_reason`.** The SDK exposes it on `finalMessage()` and we discarded it, so a reply truncated at the
  ceiling was persisted as if the model had finished and nothing in the app could tell the two apart.
  **Slice 1:** added `stopReason` to the contract (real + browser + fake clients, iOS parity) and ONE shared
  `streamWithContinuation` helper — on `max_tokens` it re-calls with the partial appended as an assistant
  message (assistant-prefill), capped at `MAX_CONTINUATIONS = 2`, budget re-checked before EACH continuation,
  **usage SUMMED so callers meter unchanged**, `extendedThinking` off on continuations (the API rejects it with
  a prefill), and **markers stripped only after stitching** so a `[[SELFOS:…]]` straddling the seam reassembles.
  Budgets raised where the fix had never reached: dream turn 1024→4096, dream opener 512→1024, intake 1024→4096
  (Sessions/Together already had it). **Slice 2 (fail-safe parity):** dream + intake now persist the user's
  message BEFORE the model call (the 05 §4.1 pattern) — they previously saved only on success, so a failed turn
  silently LOST the message; plus retry on every surface, Together's trigger generalized from transient `error`
  to a transcript predicate (a reopened session was a dead end), and the Together prep Try-again button that
  the store already supported but nothing rendered. **Slice 3 (rewind):** "Retry from here" / "Delete from
  here" via a core `truncateMessages` keyed on a **`(role, ts)` stamp, NOT a new `ChatMessage.id`** — an id
  would be absent on every message already in a vault, so it would silently fall back to index exactly where it
  matters; dropped attachments are reaped. `MessageActions` hangs off the shared `MessageRow` (hover AND
  keyboard-reachable, inline two-step confirm). **Together is append-only (one encrypted file per message), so
  removal deletes the files + appends a write-once tombstone** — with **aside-privacy inheritance**: an
  aside-only span yields a private tombstone, a mixed span yields TWO, and every derived signal
  (`turnStateFor`/`unreadCountFor`/`newestSharedHumanTs`/`digestFor`) filters them. **Slice 4 (the double
  analysis):** root-caused to one clause in `DREAM_ANALYSIS_GUIDANCE` licensing the coach to write the analysis
  as chat prose while the app's `[[SELFOS:DREAM_READY]]` marker drove the real structured artifact — two
  independent channels. Rewritten so the coach NEVER writes it inline and instead invites the person to run it
  (explicitly "unless there's more you want to talk about", per the request), with the spoken invitation bound
  to the same turn as the marker. **Slice 5 (dream artifacts):** the synthesis JSON now also returns `goals`
  (→ `extractGoals`, provenance stamped with a **stable `at`** so re-synthesis is idempotent) and a
  questionnaire proposal (→ new `mintDreamQuestionnaires`, modelled on the auto-checkin recipe: resolve
  recipient WITHOUT trusting the model with an id, validate-before-save, compensating delete if the send
  throws) — **goals cost no extra AI, riding the existing synthesis call**. **THE DURABLE OWNER DECISION
  (informed, spelled out before it was taken): a dream questionnaire is auto-created AND auto-sent, including
  to another household member, with NO review step and NO sensitive-tier carve-out** — so it can disclose to
  someone that they were dreamt about, and roughly what happened, without the dreamer seeing what was asked
  (spec 66 §8.4; the sibling of the "questionnaire tailoring uses ALL data" override). **Close-out fixes:** the
  recipient's standing opt-out gate that `mintDreamQuestionnaires` honours was **mostly inert** — the switch
  only rendered for someone who had ALREADY set up a recurring stream, so for a one-off there was no way to opt
  out in advance; `listIncomingAutoCheckinStreams` now lists every subject who COULD send (active/inactive,
  contacts excluded), with the first-time notice gated on `active`. Also fixed **`justify="between"`** — not
  valid CSS, and `Inline`/`Stack` typed the prop as `CSSProperties['justifyContent']` (effectively `string`),
  so the browser dropped it and computed `normal`: ten rows across Usage/Switcher/Together/People/Budgets bunched
  left instead of spreading, silently, for months. Both props are now closed `FlexJustify`/`FlexAlign` unions.
  Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1544 core + 1353 desktop** unit, **171 E2E** (a `SELFOS_FAKE_TRUNCATE`
  hook drives a real truncation→continuation through the UI; rewind, dream retry, the tombstone and the sent
  dream questionnaire are all decrypt-asserted). Visual QA at desktop + 360px. **Lessons: (1) a transport that
  drops `stop_reason` makes truncation STRUCTURALLY undetectable — no amount of downstream handling can
  recover it, and the offline fakes hide it completely because they always return clean output, so add the
  field at the transport and give the fake a way to simulate the failure. (2) Rewind must key on data every
  existing record already has — a `(role, ts)` stamp, not a newly-added `id` that is absent on every message
  already in a vault. (3) A prop typed `CSSProperties['justifyContent']` is `string`: it accepts values CSS
  rejects, the browser drops them silently, and jsdom does not validate CSS — so the only real defenses are a
  closed union (build error) and a computed-style assertion in real Chromium.**
- 2026-07-19 — **Release ops + doc drift (the Release workflow failed on two merges — a GitHub OUTAGE, not the
  manifest loop; and the stale `release-please-action@v4` note corrected).** After #257 + #258 landed, the
  **Release** workflow failed on **both** pushes to `main` (11s / 8s — a fast failure at the `Run release-please`
  step), so **no release PR was proposed and the dream-image fix sat on `main` unshipped**. **Diagnosed from the
  actual run log** (downloaded via the logs API after the `gh` CLI itself kept 503-ing) rather than assumed —
  and it was NOT this repo's familiar manifest-drift loop: `.release-please-manifest.json` (`0.39.0`) matched the
  latest tag (`v0.39.0`), and the error was explicit: `release-please failed: No server is currently available to
service your request.` — a **GitHub API 503**, corroborated by githubstatus.com reporting a **Minor Service
  Outage**. **No repo change is warranted; the fix is to re-run the workflow once GitHub recovers**
  (`gh run rerun <id>`), or simply let the next merge to `main` recompute it — release-please derives the whole
  proposal from scratch each run, so a missed run self-heals. **Doc drift fixed alongside:** the 2026-06-22 entry
  claimed `googleapis/release-please-action@v4` is deliberately "left" pending "a v5 major bump [that] needs
  careful testing" — but `951bb1f` (#25) **did** that bump; `release.yml` has been on **`@v5`** (release-please
  17.6.0) for a while and it cut v0.39.0 successfully. That stale sentence is now marked SUPERSEDED in place, so
  nobody "restores" v4 on the strength of it. **Lesson: a failed Release run in THIS repo pattern-matches to the
  well-documented manifest-drift loop, and that pattern-match is a trap — check the manifest against the latest
  tag FIRST (if they agree it is not drift), then read the actual run log; a transient provider outage needs a
  re-run, not a config change, and "fixing" the manifest in response would have introduced the very drift the
  loop is made of. Also: when `gh run view --log-failed` 503s, the logs ZIP endpoint
  (`/actions/runs/<id>/logs`) often still serves — retry that before giving up and guessing.**

- 2026-07-19 — **Hardening + housekeeping (the three loose ends the dream-image fix surfaced; on
  `fix/dream-carry-forward-guard-and-flakes`).** Follow-up to #257, addressing everything that fix turned up
  rather than just the one field. **(1) The ROOT CAUSE — a compile-time carry-forward guard.** `dreamSave`
  rebuilds the `Dream` from the narrower `DreamInput` plus a **hand-listed** set of main-owned fields, so the
  list is opt-in and a new additive-optional main-written field is silently droppable on the next edit (exactly
  how `Dream.image` was lost). Added `MainOwnedDreamField = Exclude<keyof Dream, keyof DreamInput>` split into
  `DreamFieldSetOnSave` / `DreamFieldCarriedForward`, with a `never` assertion that **fails the build** if
  `Dream` gains a main-owned field nobody triaged. **Verified it trips** by temporarily adding a field to
  `DreamSchema` (`error TS2322: Type 'true' is not assignable to type 'never'`). **(2) A real pre-push/CI
  flake, not a fluke.** `relayMailbox.test.ts` blocked a push with 2 timeouts; root-caused (not retried-away)
  to the PIN gate's deliberately expensive salted scrypt (N=16384) — the lockout tests burn a full
  `MAX_PIN_ATTEMPTS` run of wrong guesses, fine in isolation but over the 5s default under parallel load.
  Gave the block `{ timeout: 30_000 }` rather than weakening assertions or cheapening the KDF (**the cost IS
  the brute-force protection under test**). **(3) `site/index.html` is finally Prettier-clean.** It had been
  "pre-existing unclean, left untouched" for months, which meant it silently re-dirtied the tree and twice
  nearly rode along in an unrelated commit. Formatted for real; **proved the reflow is behaviour-preserving**
  — no `<pre>`/`white-space:pre`, and the only content change is Prettier adding an ES2017 trailing comma in
  an inline `IntersectionObserver(…, {…},)` call — then **A/B'd both versions in a real browser** (identical
  settled `scrollHeight` 20435, 19 links, 44 images, same reveals; no console errors; theme toggle still
  persists). `pnpm format:check` is now clean repo-wide for the first time. **(4) The read-then-write race —
  owner decision: "late re-read only".** `dreamSave` and `generateDreamImage` are both
  read-then-write-the-whole-record, so last-write-wins. On inspection the read was **already** immediately
  before the write, so this is a comment documenting the real (microsecond) window + the invariant that it
  must stay there, NOT a behaviour change — I'd initially overstated the window as "seconds" and corrected
  that rather than shipping a no-op dressed as a fix. Fully closing it (field-level merge in `saveDream`, or
  serialization across every dream writer) was explicitly deferred as wider than a bug fix. Gate green:
  typecheck, lint, **format repo-wide**, **1483 core + 12 relay + 1347 desktop** unit, **9 dream E2E**.
  **Lesson: when a handler rebuilds a record from a narrower input schema plus a hand-listed carry-forward,
  the list itself is the bug — patch the field, then make the NEXT one a compile error (`Exclude<keyof Full,
keyof Input>` + a `never` assertion), and prove the tripwire trips by temporarily adding a field. And a
  "pre-existing unclean" file is not inert: it re-dirties the tree and will eventually ride along in someone
  else's commit — fix it or ignore it, don't leave it half-way.**

- 2026-07-19 — **Fix (editing a dream silently DROPPED its generated image; SPEC 13 §4.2; on
  `claude/brave-hugle-19da20`).** `coreBridge.dreamSave` rebuilds the `Dream` from `DreamInputSchema.parse(input)`
  plus a few explicitly carried-forward main-owned fields (`id`/`status`/`analysisId`/`createdAt`). **`Dream.image`
  — the additive-optional image descriptor written ONLY by `dreamImageService` — was neither in `DreamInput` (so the
  renderer can never send it back) nor carried forward**, so "Edit dream" → Save dropped it: the encrypted bytes at
  `people/<id>/dreams/<id>/image.enc` were orphaned with nothing pointing at them, the image vanished from the UI,
  and any per-person `shareableWith` on the descriptor was silently revoked. **Reproduced FIRST** (a coreBridge test
  asserting `edited.image` — `undefined` before the fix), then fixed by carrying `existing.image` forward exactly the
  way `analysisId` already is (a one-line conditional spread; no schema/IPC change). Gate green: typecheck, lint,
  format, **1483 core + 12 relay + 1347 desktop** unit (+1 regression: generate → share with a partner → edit → the
  descriptor AND its `shareableWith` survive AND the bytes still resolve), **9 dream E2E** (the existing visualize
  walk extended through the real UI: Edit dream → Save → the image is still rendered on the read-first detail + a
  vault decrypt asserts the descriptor survived — **verified to FAIL with the fix reverted**, i.e. the image really
  does disappear on screen). **Lesson: when a handler rebuilds a record from a narrower renderer INPUT schema plus a
  hand-listed set of carried-forward fields, every main-owned field is opt-in — adding an additive-optional field to
  the full schema (`Dream.image`) silently makes it droppable on the next edit. Audit the carry-forward list against
  the full schema whenever a main-written field is added; a bridge round-trip test alone isn't enough — drive the
  edit through the UI, since the user-visible symptom is the image disappearing.**

- 2026-07-17 — **Build + durable owner decision (Memory insights — context header, card grid, nav badge &

  state). A questionnaire card links `From "<title>"` → that questionnaire's **Results** — powered by a read-time
  `resolveInsightSource` enrichment in `insightsList` (assignment snapshot title + live id) + additive-optional
  `sourceTitle`/`sourceQuestionnaireId` on `InsightProvenanceSchema` (never persisted, no migration — the aboutName
  precedent). **(3) Card grid** — life-area sections (+ review drafts + search) render insight cards in a responsive
  `auto-fill minmax(320px)` grid (portrait spans full-row; 1-up at ≤560px). **(4) THE durable decision — ALL insights
  default to shared-with-partner** (owner emphatic, "I MEANT ALL"): a central `insights/producedFactShare(restricted)`
  flips every producer's fact default to `shareableTypes: ['partner']` (session/dream/dream-pattern/Together/challenge/
  questionnaire-analysis + the compat **report**; self-assessments already did it), and a one-time idempotent
  `backfillPartnerSharing` (run once-per-person in `insightsList`, persisted) brings **existing** insights up to it.
  The two hard carve-outs, **not** flipped because they're EXPLICIT choices: break-glass **`restricted`** facts
  (`factSharedWithViewer` structurally blocks them; onboarding trauma/intimacy opt-outs) + explicit per-send
  visibility (compat **`contextOnly`** §16.2) / onboarding scopes; the backfill touches only never-configured
  default-private facts (preserving `restricted`/flagged/`shareableTypes:[]`/`shareableWith`) + skips intake +
  compatibility. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1475 core + 1308 desktop** unit (+`shareDefaults` [6:
  producedFactShare + backfill idempotency/preserves-explicit/skips-intake+compat], +`resolveInsightSource` [4], +`memoryReviewCount` [3], +Memory RTL About-you chip + linked source, +the analysis-test partner-default update,
  +a coreBridge source-enrichment + decrypt-level backfill-persisted test), **16 memory E2E** (the dashboard test
  extended: nav badge + About chip + `display:grid` + decrypt the partner backfill; #129 re-pointed to the About-chip;
  the overview test's manual-scope fact seeded `shareableTypes:[]` so the backfill preserves it). Real-Electron visual
  QA at desktop (2-up grid + Shared:Partner chips) + 360px (the fixed draft review state, no overflow). **Lesson:
  "share ALL by default" is safe as a flip of the unset DEFAULT + a backfill that preserves every EXPLICIT choice
  (restricted, empty-array-private, per-person, contextOnly) — the break-glass `restricted` gate is structural, so
  producers must never put `shareableTypes` on a restricted fact; and a seeded E2E fact that a manual-scope test
  relies on being "private" must be seeded `shareableTypes:[]` (explicit) once a backfill exists, or the backfill
  shares it and the test can't find the "private" chip. See [[insights-shared-with-partner-default]].**
- 2026-07-17 — **Build (Your Story §13 CLOSE-OUT — the two deferred follow-ups, so §13 is 100% complete; SPEC 64
  §13.6.5; on `feat/story-closeout`, PR pending).** After R1–R7 shipped (v0.35.0), closed the two remaining
  deferrals so the full-surface redesign has nothing outstanding. **(1) The answered-history chapter linkage
  (§13.6.5, deferred in R5):** `listAnsweredStoryCheckIns` now populates `wroteIntoChapterTitle` **deterministically
  (no AI)** — it builds two maps (assignmentId → the analysis Insight id via `insight.provenance.assignmentId`;
  insightId → the earliest chapter title by `order` whose paragraph `provenance.refs` cite that insight of
  `kind:'insight'`) and joins the answered story check-in to the chapter its material wove into. The link appears
  once the answer is analyzed (an approved insight) AND a chapter that draws on it is (re)drafted citing it —
  absent (falls back to the answered date) otherwise, honestly. The InterviewTab renderer already displayed
  `wroteIntoChapterTitle` ("wove into <chapter>") when present (R5 built the UI, the field was just never
  populated), so this is a core-only fill + tests. **(2) The shared `--color-scrim` token (deferred R4-polish):**
  the three Story-local overlay scrims (to-do sheet, export dialog, delete/rewrite dialog) all used a hardcoded
  `rgb(15 12 9 / 0.34)` → one `--color-scrim` design-system token in `tokens.css` (byte-identical, a pure DRY
  refactor). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1469 core + 1313 desktop** unit (+`listAnsweredStoryCheckIns`
  chapter-linkage core [links via the insight→chapter-provenance chain; absent when not yet woven]; +the Story
  RTL answered-history now asserts both "wove into <chapter>" AND the date fallback), **7 story E2E** (no
  regression; the scrim change is validated by the build). **§13 (The Studio & the Book) has NO remaining
  deferrals — it is 100% complete, R1–R7 + close-out.** (The R3-polish spawn_task the user later started in a
  separate session is redundant — R3-polish already merged as `7d91d5c`.) **Lesson: a "deferred, deterministic-
  only" field the renderer already displays is a core-only fill — derive the link from the data chain that
  already exists (answered check-in → its analysis insight's `provenance.assignmentId` → the chapter whose
  paragraph provenance cites that insight), keep it best-effort ("where derivable", absent when not yet woven),
  and no schema/renderer change is needed.**

- 2026-07-17 — **Build (Your Story R7 — the Begin screens: invitation · commission · the writing; SPEC 64 §13.3/
  §13.7; on `feat/story-begin-screens`, PR pending; the FINAL slice of the approved full-surface redesign — §13
  is now BUILT R1–R7).** The three "begin" surfaces redesigned + the one new backend read. **Backend:** a
  deterministic, crypto-free **`story:corpusStats`** (`getStoryCorpusStats` — session/reflection/dream counts + a
  year span from the dated material; no AI; gated `story.own` + active-person-scoped; zeroed when denied) through
  the whole seam, + a static **`specimen: { first, third }`** on every `BookType` style preset (a sample sentence
  per register × voice — demonstration prose, never a real fact). **Invitation** (no-book empty state): a
  book-cover hero + the three-step promise (It reads · It writes · It keeps writing) + a **"Drawn from"** chip row
  with the real counts (pure `drawnFromChips`) + the privacy line + "Begin your book"; the "Shared with you" shelf
  below. **Commission** (setup): a **live-preview rail** — a cover mock taking the typed title + a **specimen
  sentence** ("How your biographer will sound", pure `specimenFor`, re-rendered per style × voice) — with style as
  a **card gallery** (`role="radiogroup"` radio cards, §12-safe auto-fill grid) + length as three cards with
  reading-terms sublabels + a time-expectation footer. **The writing** (draft progress): the **essence line**
  appears when foundations land, the **outline reveals itself** (a two-column chapter list with
  done/current/upcoming markers from the progress stream), and the note gains a real **"Browse SelfOS ›"** exit

  screens at desktop + 360px, light + dark; the whole-flow coherence walk (invitation → commission → writing →
  Studio) — no redundant asks, colliding labels, or dead controls. **Lesson: the begin screens are the last
  mile of a big redesign, so keep the pure logic testable in ISOLATION — `drawnFromChips`/`specimenFor` are pure
  functions in a `begin.ts` (unit-tested without a DOM), the specimens are static data on the style presets (a
  BookType carries its own, so a future book type is self-contained), and a card-gallery Style picker replacing a
  `<select>` means the RTL/E2E move from `getByRole('option')` to `getByRole('radio')` in a labelled radiogroup.**
- 2026-07-17 — **Build (auto check-ins consent model — target visibility & control; SPEC 63 §3.3a amended +
  BUILT; on `feat/autocheckin-target-control`, a worktree, PR pending).** The follow-up to the provenance-badge
  audit (#244): an owner could unilaterally configure RECURRING auto check-ins to a partner with no standing way
  for the partner to see or stop them (only a per-item decline). **Design decided with the user (2 forks):**
  transparency-first (the target always sees who's sending them check-ins + a one-tap stop — no accept
  handshake) and the insight flow stays owner-facing (raw answers still private). Spec-first: wrote spec 63 §3.3a
  (+ §4.5 storage, §6.6 IPC, amended the §2 no-consent non-goal). **Built end-to-end:** a person's standing
  **opt-out** (`people/<target>/questionnaires/autoCheckinBlocks.enc`, additive `AutoCheckinBlocksSchema`, the
  target's own data) is a **hard gate** in `resolveEligibility` — a blocked sender fails closed
  (`reason:'blocked-by-recipient'`), re-checked every run, so a block takes effect immediately regardless of the
  owner's config; `listIncomingAutoCheckinStreams(viewer)` enumerates household configs for enabled streams
  targeting the viewer (name + cadence + intimacy flag + the blocked flag), **strictly scoped to streams aimed at
  the viewer** and never exposing the owner's private exploration focus. Seam: `autoCheckins:incomingStreams`/
  `:getBlocks`/`:setBlock` — NOT gated on `questionnaires.autoCheckin` (a person can be targeted without holding
  it), active-person-scoped in the bridge (a person edits only their OWN blocks). Renderer: a **"Check-ins others
  send you"** section on the AutoCheckinsPanel (per-sender Receiving/Turned-off `Switch`); the Auto check-ins tab
  now appears when the viewer has incoming streams even with no own config, so the control is always reachable. A
  **first-time notice** (`auto-checkin-incoming` notification, one per new sender, per-person). **Insight flow +
  raw-answer privacy unchanged** (owner-facing insight, private answers never cross). Gate green: typecheck,
  lint, format, **1467 core + 1307 desktop** unit (+core block-gate/unblock + `listIncomingAutoCheckinStreams`
  scope; +a coreBridge two-persona trust-boundary test [partner sees + stops, scoped per person, owner never sees

  a partner → switch to the partner → the toast fires + the "Check-ins others send you" section shows the owner
  → turn it off → **decrypt** the partner's block file contains the owner). Real-Electron visual QA (the section
  - the first-time toast). **Lesson: a "no-consent" model softens cleanly into "transparency + a hard opt-out"
    without an accept-handshake — store the block in the TARGET's own vault (their data, owner can't override),
    re-check it in the eligibility gate every run (fail-closed), and make the see-and-stop surface reachable even
    for a targeted person who lacks the feature's own capability (gate the tab on incoming-streams, not just the
    config).**

- 2026-07-17 — **Build (Your Story R6 — Photos tab redesign + the photo-answers-reach-the-biographer wiring fix;
  SPEC 64 §13.6.2/§13.7; on `feat/story-photos-corpus`, PR pending; part of the approved full-surface redesign).**
  The sixth slice of the §13 rebuild. **The functional fix (§13.6.2 — a working-but-wrong gap the redesign audit
  found):** §3.7 promised a photo's answered Q&A feeds generation, but `buildStoryCorpus` never read
  `interview.enc.photoAnswers` — the answer persisted and fed nothing. Now `buildStoryCorpus(fs, key, personId,
bookId, exclusions?)` takes a `bookId` and reads the photo answers + the image index, emitting **one corpus item
  per photo the person ANSWERED about** (caption + every answered Q&A, `sourceRef.kind:'photo'`, exclusion-filtered
  via `add()` so a `source` exclusion on the imageId drops it, book-scoped; a caption-only photo feeds nothing —
  a bare AI caption is the model's guess, not the subject's words). Threaded `bookId` through all **six** callers
  (generation foundations/chapter/revision, refresh, freshness, structure-pass, gap-pass); `generateFoundations`
  gained `opts.bookId` (both bridge callers pass it). **No schema change** (`photoAnswers` + the image index
  already existed). **The Photos tab redesign:** the vertical `photoRow` list → a responsive `.photoGrid` gallery
  of cards (cover image at 4/3 · caption · a "N memories captured" accent chip · the answered Q&A inline ·
  Caption-&-ask/Remove actions bottom-aligned), single-column at ≤480px — every accessible name/flow preserved so
  the answering path is byte-unchanged. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1444 core + 1293 desktop** unit (+3
  `storyCorpus` [caption+answers feed as a `photo` item; source-exclusion drops it; book-scoped — B never picks up
  A's answers]; +1 Story RTL [gallery renders caption + captured-memories chip + answer]; every `buildStoryCorpus`/
  `generateFoundations` caller updated), **7 story E2E** — the photo E2E rewritten to **prove the fix**: upload →
  vision caption + answer → "Find what's missing" → the captured gap prompt (`SELFOS_FAKE_PROMPT_DIR`) contains
  the answer verbatim. Real-Electron visual QA at desktop (2-up gallery) + 360px (single column, no overflow).
  **Lesson: an E2E that captures a generation prompt via the gap pass has to defeat the AUTONOMOUS interview
  cadence — it fires on Studio mount, mints a check-in, and then the ≤1-open invariant BLOCKS the manual gap pass
  so it never re-runs with the fresh corpus; the captured file ends up being the auto cadence's early prompt
  (pre-photo-answer). Gate the auto cadence behind a main-only test hook (`SELFOS_FAKE_STORY_NO_CADENCE`, read via
  a `globalThis` cast so shared coreBridge still typechecks under the web lib) and POLL the captured file — never
  wait on a UI-text signal a static always-present description (\"Questions arrive in your Inbox…\") also matches,
  which resolves the wait before the async pass has written anything.**
- 2026-07-17 — **Fix (Questionnaires post-release follow-ups: sort/group float + softer attention pill + Received
  sort; user-reported on v0.33.0; SPEC 08 §3.1; on `fix/questionnaire-sort-grouping`, a worktree, PR pending).**
  Three issues after the tabs shipped. **(1) "Recently analyzed" left un-analyzed at the TOP.** Diagnosed (not a
  comparator bug — `sortSent` already sinks empty-`analyzedAt` entries): the Sent tab keeps fixed-lifecycle
  status subgroups (Drafts → Awaiting → Answered → **Analyzed** last), and the sort only reorders WITHIN a group,
  so the Analyzed group stayed pinned at the bottom regardless. **Asked the user** how sort + grouping should
  interact (flat vs float-group vs toggle) → chose **keep groups, float the relevant group up**. New pure
  **`orderSentGroups`** ranks each group by the max sort value among its entries (pre-sorted, so `entries[0]`);
  the group carrying the sort's date floats to the top, groups with no such date sink, "Title" keeps lifecycle
  order — so "Recently analyzed"/"Recently answered" put the Analyzed/Answered group first. **(2) The amber
  attention count** (Received tab) was a harsh dark-yellow-on-black pill → new theme-aware
  `--color-warning-subtle-bg`/`--color-warning-subtle-text` tokens (light + dark), a soft warm pill. **(3) The
  Received tab had no sort** → added `sortReceived` (Recently received [default] · Recently answered · Title A–Z;
  favourites pinned, missing-date items sink) + a sort `<select>` in its toolbar. Gate green: typecheck, lint,
  format, **1423 core + 1299 desktop** unit (+`orderSentGroups` float/title, +`receivedSort` [3], +2 Questionnaires
  RTL: group-float via `compareDocumentPosition` + the Received sort control), the redesign + author-scoped + 30
  questionnaire/auto-checkin E2E green. Real-Electron visual QA (the soft amber "Received 1" + the Answered group
  floated to the top under the default sort). **Lesson: a status-grouped list with a sort dropdown has a hidden
  conflict — the sort only orders WITHIN groups, so a fixed group order silently overrides it; when the user
  expects a sort to reorder the whole list, float the matching GROUP (rank groups by their max sort value), don't
  just sort inside. And a `default`-sort RTL can't assert "lifecycle order" once the default sort itself reorders
  groups — pick a neutral sort (`recent`) as the before-state to prove the reorder.**
- 2026-07-17 — **Audit + Fix (user reported a suspected privacy leak: partner-named questionnaires in their Sent
  list; deep audit → NOT a leak, but a real labeling gap; SPEC 08 §3.1; on `fix/sent-provenance-badges`, a
  worktree, PR pending).** User saw questionnaires (recipients both "Angel" + "Ben") under one Sent page and
  feared user questionnaires were being revealed to others. **Deep audit (2 parallel trace agents + the trust
  boundary read; NOT assumed):** (1) the **biographer never sends to anyone but the story owner** (self-send,
  `type:'general'`, `storyProvenance`); (2) the cards were **auto check-ins** (their AI-generated `type`s —
  "Partner Discovery", "Money & Roots" — come from the gap-finder via `topicalSpec`; intimacy slot →
  `type:'intimacy'`); (3) auto check-ins attribute to the **config owner** (creator+sender), self→`standard`
  ("Answers visible"), partner→`private` ("Private · insights only"), all landing in the owner's Sent list. The
  screenshot's pattern (partner=visible, self=private) matched the config owner having a self stream + a
  partner-targeted stream — **user CONFIRMED** (self + partner streams). **Verdict: NOT a cross-user leak** — Sent
  is strictly `senderPersonId === you`, and a partner-targeted send is `private` so its **raw answers never cross
  the bridge** to the owner. **Root cause of the alarm: auto/biographer questionnaires were indistinguishable
  from hand-authored ones on the Sent card** (the recipient's Inbox labels them; the sender's Sent side didn't).
  **Fix A (this PR):** a distinct **"Auto check-in" / "From your biographer"** provenance pill on the SentCard
  (reads `questionnaire.autoCheckin`/`storyProvenance`; renderer-only, no schema/IPC/trust-boundary change).
  Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1293 desktop** unit (+a SentCard provenance RTL: exactly the two
  generated cards labelled, hand-authored none — scoped with `within(tabpanel)` since `/Auto check-in/` also
  matches the "Auto check-ins" TAB), redesign + author-scoped + home E2E green; real-Electron visual QA (the
  "Auto check-in" pill next to the status + privacy chips). **Fix B (deferred, user chose "design a fix"):** a
  spec-63 consent-model amendment — an owner can currently configure RECURRING partner check-ins unilaterally,
  and from the partner's PRIVATE answers an AI insight ABOUT them is derived + fed into the OWNER's coaching
  context (`subjectPersonId = senderPersonId`) with no partner consent; to be written up + approved before
  building. **Lesson: a "revealing others' data?!" report is often a LABELING gap, not a boundary breach —
  audit the trust boundary FIRST (sender-scoping + the private-answer gate held), then fix the missing provenance
  signal so owner-configured/auto/biographer sends never read as a hand-authored leak; the privacy PATTERN in a
  screenshot (self=visible vs partner=private) is enough to identify the config owner without decrypting the
  vault.**

- 2026-07-17 — **Build (Questionnaires landing → a 3-tab surface + nav badge + toolbar spacing + Recently-analyzed
  sort; mockup approved FIRST; SPEC 08 §3.1; on `feat/questionnaires-tabs-nav`, a worktree, PR pending).** Four
  user-requested improvements, mockup (interactive Artifact in the app's real tokens) shown + 3 decisions locked via
  AskUserQuestion BEFORE code: 3 tabs as-shown, ONE aggregate sidebar badge, add `analyzedAt` to the backend. **(1)**
  The two stacked collapsible sections (Sent / Received) + an `AutoCheckinsPanel` appended at the bottom → a
  **three-tab** surface **Sent · Received · Auto check-ins** (63) so auto check-ins is a first-class destination, no
  longer lost at the scroll bottom; the Auto tab shows only when `autoAvailable` (config !== null), each tab carries a
  light count (Sent total · Received total, amber when any to-answer · Auto on/off dot), `role="tab"`/`tablist` +
  `aria-selected`; within Sent the status subgroups/toolbar/pagination are unchanged. **(2)** Fixed the toolbar's two
  `<select>`s being 2px apart — `.toolbar` gap + bordered controls + a `.tbSpacer` pushing filter/sort right of search.
  **(3)** A **Questionnaires sidebar nav badge** = a pure `questionnaireNavCount` (**ready-to-analyze** +
  **received-to-answer**; passive "awaiting their response" excluded), aggregate per the owner's choice (knowingly
  double-counts received-to-answer with the Inbox badge); AppShell now loads `sentOverview` on person-change so the
  badge has data everywhere. **(4)** Sort adds **"Recently analyzed"** + **defaults to "Recently answered"** (was
  "Recently sent"), backed by an additive **`QuestionnaireSentOverview.analyzedAt`** (the latest analysed send's
  Insight `updatedAt`, derived in the bridge). **§12 fit:** the `.tabs` strip tightens at ≤480px so all 3 fixed tabs
  fit at 360px with **no horizontal scroll** (the E2E overflow guard's `inner===0` proved it). Gate green: typecheck,
  lint, format, **1423 core + 1281 desktop** unit (+navCounts, +sentGrouping analyzed/answered sort, +coreBridge
  `analyzedAt`, +Questionnaires RTL tabs/sort/auto-tab; the 4 section-collapse RTL re-pointed through the tabs), the
  redesign + author-scoped + 3 auto-checkin E2E re-pointed through the tabs (+28 questionnaire E2E green). Real-Electron
  visual QA at desktop + 360px (clean tab bar, spaced toolbar, sidebar badge; tabs fit at phone width). **Lesson: a
  §12 overflow guard flags any `overflow-x:auto` element whose content exceeds it — a fixed-N tab strip must be sized
  to FIT (tighten padding/font at ≤480px) rather than relying on scroll; the `overflow-x:auto` then only ever acts as
  inert insurance. And restructuring stacked sections → tabs breaks only the section-collapse tests: re-point each to
  a `getByRole('tab')` click, since the card rendering itself is unchanged.**
- 2026-07-17 — **Build (Questionnaires read-and-answer redesign — per-question skip/decline + self-contained
  generation + the unlocked answering wizard; SPEC 08 §25; mockup approved FIRST; on
  `feat/questionnaire-answering-redesign`, slices 1+2+3 built (1+2 = PR #241); the landing card-alignment fix shipped
  separately as PR #235).** The user hit three frictions answering a questionnaire — a generated question
  referenced "that health worry" with no context; you couldn't see all questions or move past one without
  answering; no way to decline a single question. Asked the 4 forks first (AskUserQuestion): **unlock the wizard**
  (keep one-at-a-time, drop the required-blocks-Next gate + add a jump navigator) · **one skip with a reason**
  (presets incl. "Not clear — needs more context" = the unclear flag, + free text) · **required = answer OR
  explicitly decline** · **whole-area redesign** (answering → Results → builder → landing). Built an **interactive
  mockup in the app's real tokens, approved as the visual contract** before any redesign code. **Slice 1 (backend
  spine):** a per-question decline is modeled as an ADDITIVE `Answer` **value** shape `{declined:true, reason?}`
  (`DeclinedAnswerSchema` + a union arm; **no `schemaVersion` bump**), so it rides the existing `{questionId,value}`
  - the relay `submit.answers` with NO structural change; `answering.ts` gains `isDeclined`, guards `isAnswered`,
    and `unansweredRequired` treats a decline as SATISFYING a required question; **every consumer made decline-robust**
    — `analyzeAssignment`, `generateAlignment`, AND `distillContextOnly` exclude a skip from the analyzed Q→A (the
    reason never reaches the model nor becomes an inferred fact), aggregate/trends drop it from distributions, and
    `recipientHistory` omits it (Story/de-dup); the "that health worry" bug fixed at the SOURCE with a
    `GENERATION_SYSTEM` self-contained rule + a conservative `hasDanglingReference` backstop. code-reviewer fix-first
    caught a real `distillContextOnly` decline leak (the third analysis-into-Insight path) + the alignment
    branch-orphan filter. **Slice 2 (answering UX):** the redesigned `QuestionnaireForm` wizard — a **navigator**
    (state chips ✓/⊘/•/\* + a "See all questions" overview, jump to any), **free navigation** (Next never blocks), a
    **per-question skip** ("Skip this" → an amber reason box with the presets + free text → a decline value; an
    "Answer it instead" undo), and a **Review** step that gates Send until every required question is answered OR
    skipped. It's **host-contract-preserving** — since the decline rides as an `AnswerValue`, the in-app Inbox AND the
    external relay page light up with **no host/relay change** (the whole-questionnaire `onDecline` stays distinct);
    serif prompts (`--font-serif`, Georgia fallback on the relay), + `--color-warning`/`--color-success` added to the
    relay tokens (subtle bgs via `color-mix`). Gate green: typecheck (all 4 packages), lint, format, **1448 core + 203
    coreBridge + 1280 desktop + 12 relay** unit (the wizard RTL/Inbox/RelayApp tests rewritten from the old
    required-blocks-Next flow to the unlocked/Review flow; +skip/navigator/review/self-contained cases), an inbox E2E
    driving the full skip loop through the real UI → **decrypt asserts the persisted `{declined:true, reason}`** + the
    "See all" overview + a 360px overflow guard, and the affected answering E2Es re-pointed to Review & send.
    Real-Electron visual QA of the question / see-all / reason-picker / skipped / review screens (matches the approved
    mockup — dusty-blue accent, Lora serif prompts, amber skip). **Lesson: modeling a per-question decline as an
    additive `Answer` VALUE shape (not a sibling field or a new relay kind) is what makes the whole redesign
    host-contract-preserving — the Inbox + relay + persistence + break-glass all flow it unchanged, and the only real
    work is (a) making every AI-analysis consumer exclude it [there were THREE: analyze, align, distill] and (b) the
    one shared `QuestionnaireForm` wizard, which both hosts already drive.** **Slice 3 (Sender Results) also
    BUILT:** the at-a-glance aggregate gains additive Standard-only `skipped`/`unclear` counts (the "Not clear"
    preset canonicalized in core as `UNCLEAR_SKIP_REASON`, shared so the picker + the count can't drift), each
    question card shows an amber "N found it unclear · M skipped · consider rewording it" callout, and a skip
    renders as a distinct "Skipped" chip in the per-recipient answers (DRYing the inline markup onto the shared
    `AnswerList`). **Slice 4 (Builder) also BUILT:** a self-contained-question authoring guardrail — a quiet amber
    note under a prompt that makes a dangling back-reference (`hasDanglingReference`), closing the "that health
    worry" loop from the authoring side. **Slice 5 (broader Landing) — DELIVERED, not deferred:** the reported
    card-alignment issue shipped as **PR #235** (single-line sender chip + a 2-line title clamp/reserve so pills,
    meta + CTA line up across a row), and the broad landing redesign the user asked for **landed via the
    mockup-approved `feat/questionnaires-tabs-nav`** (merged) — the two stacked collapsible sections became a
    **three-tab surface** (Sent · Received · Auto check-ins) with a nav badge, a spaced toolbar (search + status +
    a Recently-answered/analyzed sort) and status-grouped cards. This redesign **rebased cleanly onto that** (it
    touches the answering form / builder / Results, never the landing route), and real-Electron visual QA of the
    composed landing (screenshot) reads clean + cohesive with the redesigned answering flow. A further speculative
    density pass on the cards would **regress** the just-built alignment reserve (`.cardTitleButton min-height:2.6em`
    is deliberate, not waste), so the landing is genuinely complete — every concrete ask (card spacing, sleek/modern
    surface) is met by the combination. **Lesson: when concurrent mockup-approved work lands the exact surface your
    own plan reserved a "broad pass" for, the honest move is to recognize it's DELIVERED and NOT churn freshly-tuned
    work — "100% complete" means every user ask is met, not that you invented extra changes.**

  §13 written + approved; R1 "Studio IA" BUILT on `feat/story-studio-ia`, PR pending).** The user rejected the
  shipped Your Story surface as thrown-together ("completely REDESIGN FROM SCRATCH… generate mockup for ALL the
  screens I can review first… EVERY SCREEN"). Process: mapped the whole feature (2 explore agents: renderer +
  core/capabilities), captured **real screenshots** of the current UI, then built a **16-screen interactive
  Artifact mockup** in the app's real tokens + embedded Lora/Mulish (invitation · commission · writing · Studio
  ×5 tabs · reader front-matter/read/shape/review · reader-view · export · danger · edge states), verified it in
  a headless browser (no console errors, no 360px overflow, dark + phone toggles), and got it **approved as the
  visual contract** before any code. One product decision asked + locked: reader **read receipts = yes**. Wrote
  spec **64 §13** (the Studio & the Book) + a 7-slice build plan (R1 Studio IA → R2 read → R3 shape → R4
  sharing/export → R5 interview → R6 photos → R7 begin/polish), superseding §3.1–§3.6's _layouts_ while every §3
  _mechanic_ (markup, batch apply, publish gate, interview engine, exclusions, freshness) is reused unchanged.
  **R1 BUILT:** the old one-page card stack → a **Studio** — a hero (cover + title/Rename + essence + config
  chips + freshness + completeness + Read/Refresh/⋯ kebab), a **"Needs you"** strip (proposals · to-review ·
  to-dos, self-hiding to a calm "all caught up"), and **five tabs** (Chapters · Photos · Interview · Sharing ·
  Settings) with the existing panels relocated (Settings = matter + Writing/Images [collapsible dropped for open
  groups] + exclusions + **Danger zone**); a book-level **to-do sheet**; a `story/*` **splat route** so tabs
  deep-link + survive reload (mirrored to `useState` so it also works with no Route in RTL). The **chapter reader
  stays the existing `ChapterReader`** (the immersive Book view is R2/R3 — R1 doesn't touch the markup surface, so
  its whole test suite stayed green). One new backend op: core **`rewriteBookFromScratch`** (keeps config/title/
  matter/cover/uploaded-photos/exclusions/interview + the published head; discards chapters/markup/proposals/
  outline/timeline/essence + only AI-generated illustrations) + the `story:rewriteFromScratch` channel through the
  whole seam (gated `story.own` + active-person-scoped); the store's `rewriteFromScratch` resets then re-runs the
  standard streamed draft (mirroring `createAndDraft`). Danger zone: type-to-confirm delete (arms only on the
  exact title) + the rewrite dialog (honest keeps/discards). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1420 core +
  1270 desktop** unit (+core rewrite keeps/discards + missing-book null; +coreBridge rewrite round-trip + Guest
  denial; +Story RTL: tab deep-link, type-to-confirm delete, rewrite-then-redraft; the 10 relocated-surface RTL
  updated to switch tabs), **6 story E2E** (the 3 relocated walks re-pointed through the tabs; +a Studio-tabs +
  Danger-zone delete walk with a 360px overflow guard). Real-Electron visual QA at desktop + 360px, light + dark.
  **Lesson: a huge single-page → multi-tab re-architecture is low-risk if you PRESERVE the deep interactive
  surface (the chapter reader/markup) untouched behind a still-reachable card — its whole test suite stays green,
  and the churn collapses to (a) the container rebuild + (b) inserting a "switch to tab X" click in each
  relocated-surface test. Excise a 400-line function deterministically with a Python marker, then author the
  replacement via validated Edits; drive tab state from a splat route mirrored to `useState` so it works both
  under a real Route (deep-link/reload) and rendered bare in RTL.**
- 2026-07-17 — **Build (Your Story §13 R2 — the immersive Book reader; SPEC 64 §13.7 R2 BUILT on
  `feat/story-book-reader`, PR pending).** The second slice of the approved redesign: reading the book actually
  feels like reading a book. A unified **`BookReader`** (one component for the owner AND a granted reader) renders
  **front matter first** (a cover "book" · a serif title page · dedication · epigraph · a contents page with
  per-chapter status marks · a Begin/Continue/From-the-beginning affordance) → a **chapter page** (opener art =
  **the chapter's own illustration → the book cover → a warm dusk-gradient fallback** [§13.5; the promoted image
  is excluded from the inline figures so it never renders twice] · **Lora prose with a drop cap** on the first
  paragraph · pinned pull-quotes · placed figures · prev/next) → **back matter** (acknowledgments · a-note-on-this-book · a colophon
  with the not-medical line) on the last chapter; a slim reader bar carries **‹ Studio/Back · the title · Ch. N of
  M · an aA text-size toggle** (cycles a hidden `story.readerFontSize` device setting). The Studio hero **"Read
  your story"** + the `/story/read` deep-link both enter it, and the owner gets an inline **"Edit this chapter ›"**
  that drops into the existing `ChapterReader` markup editor. **The shared reader was migrated onto the same
  component** (so household readers get the identical immersive experience). One new backend piece: core
  **`readOwnBook`** — the owner reads their OWN book from the **DRAFT head** (a synthetic manifest with a **live**
  honesty note reusing `noteOnBook`, per-chapter `status` + `pinnedQuotes`, parts/order from the outline keeping
  only **written** chapters so an unwritten shell never shows a blank page); since it's the person's own data the
  **full projection is safe** — unlike the cross-person minimal `readSharedBook` which still projects the minimal
  shape with **no provenance** (the R2 `ReaderChapter.status`/`pinnedQuotes` widening is own-book-only, verified
  it doesn't reach the shared path). **Resume is device-local + per-person** (`DeviceState.storyReadPosition` =
  personId → bookId → chapterId) via `story:setReadPosition`; `story:readOwnBook` returns `{ view, lastChapterId }`
  where `lastChapterId` only resolves to a chapter that **still exists** (never a dangling resume) — both channels
  gated `story.own` + active-person-scoped in the bridge (the trust boundary), the key never crossing IPC. Gate
  green: typecheck, lint, format, **1423 core + 1274 desktop** unit (+`readOwnBook` draft-head/status/
  unwritten-shell/null; +a coreBridge readOwnBook + resumable setReadPosition [ghost-chapter → null] + Guest
  denial; +3 Story RTL owner-reader deep-link + hero navigation + opener-uses-the-chapter-illustration-not-
  duplicated-inline, the shared-reader RTL updated to the front-matter→chapter flow), **7 story E2E** (a new
  owner-reader walk: front matter → Begin reading → chapter prose → aA changes the reader scale → Edit reaches the
  editor → back to Studio + a 360px overflow guard; the publish/shared-reader walk updated to Begin-reading-first).
  Real-Electron visual QA at desktop + 360px, light + dark (cover/title-page front matter, chapter opener +
  drop-cap prose + prev/next, the settled 360px column, and the dark theme all read as an intentional, book-like
  reader). **code-reviewer verdict ship** — the one applied follow-up was the §13.5 opener precedence (was
  cover-only; now the chapter's own illustration leads, matching R1's card grid + the mockup, excluded from inline
  figures). **Lesson: the owner's "read my own book" is not a
  second reader — build ONE `BookReader` and feed it from `readOwnBook` (draft head, own-data full projection) vs
  `readSharedBook` (published head, cross-person minimal projection); widening the shared `ReaderChapter` view type
  for the owner's richer needs (status/pinned-quotes) is only safe because the CROSS-person builder keeps emitting
  the minimal shape — the view type permits the fields, the shared builder still omits them. A device-local resume
  position must resolve against the CURRENT chapters (a deleted/renamed chapter → resume null), or a stale marker
  dead-ends the reader.**
- 2026-07-17 — **Build (Your Story §13 R3 — the what-changed diff, the Shape ribbon & the Read⇄Shape toggle;
  SPEC 64 §13.7 R3 [core] BUILT on `feat/story-shape-review`, PR pending).** The third slice of the redesign:
  editing a chapter is now a **mode of the reader** and leads with a real diff. **R3a (backend):** an additive
  **`BookChapter.previousMarkdown`** keeps the pre-rewrite text — captured in `generateChapter` (the rewrite path
  only; a first draft carries none) + `applyMarkup`, **cleared when a chapter is marked Reviewed** (the bridge
  writes `previousMarkdown: undefined`, dropped on the JSON write) — plus a pure, dependency-free **`wordDiff`**/
  `hasChanges` (LCS over words, whitespace-insensitive) in `@selfos/core/story`, exposed to the renderer via a
  lean **`@selfos/core/story-diff`** subpath export (avoids bundling the crypto-heavy story barrel). **R3b
  (renderer):** a new/updated chapter leads with a **`ChapterRibbon`** — "New chapter" / "Rewritten from new
  material" · a **"What changed"** toggle revealing an inline word-diff (added words `<ins>` green, removed
  `<del>` struck red) · **"Looks good ✓"** (the existing review) — collapsing to a calm "✓ Reviewed" once
  reviewed; and a **Read⇄Shape toggle** — a compact **"Shape"** button in the reader bar (owner-only, on a
  chapter page) + a "Shape this chapter ›" end-affordance, both entering the existing `ChapterReader` markup
  editor from the reader (staying on `/story/read`). The **`applyMarkup` call-count invariants are untouched** —
  R3 restyles the entry + adds the ribbon, the markup backend is unchanged. code-reviewer **fix-first** — one
  should-fix applied (a **`stale`** chapter now leads with the ribbon too — "New material to fold in" + the
  spend-free "Looks good ✓" accept action; R3b's removal of the old bottom review button had left a stale chapter
  with no status cue AND no non-metered way to be reviewed) + two nits (a `MAX_DIFF_CELLS` cap so `wordDiff`
  degrades to a coarse whole-block diff past ~1M word-cells instead of an unbounded LCS table; `useMemo` on the
  render + a `role="group"` label on the diff). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format,
  **1429 core + 1278 desktop** unit (+`wordDiff` [6, incl. the cell-cap fallback]; `previousMarkdown`
  captured-on-rewrite/apply + no-prior-on-first-draft; +coreBridge review-clears; +3 Story RTL [ribbon+diff
  reveal/hide, first-draft-no-toggle, stale-keeps-its-review]; the R2 owner-reader RTL/E2E re-pointed to the Shape
  toggle), **7 story E2E** (the author-spine walk asserts the ribbon + reveals the word-diff after a revision).
  Real-Electron visual QA (the ribbon, the red/green word-diff, the reader-bar Shape toggle — all clean, book-like). **Deferred as an honest R3-polish fast-follow** (the Shape
  editing surface still uses the pre-redesign editor layout — functional + tested, not yet the immersive
  margin-based mockup look): numbered **superscript sources**, **margin-rail marks** at ≥900px, and the right-hand
  **Review & apply sheet** + bottom pending pill — folded into the R7 polish sweep (a spawn_task tracks it).
  \*\*Lesson: a "restyle the editing machinery" slice is lowest-risk when you keep the markup BACKEND (and its
  applyMarkup call-count invariants + whole test suite) untouched and only change the ENTRY (a Read⇄Shape toggle)
  - add a read-only overlay (the ribbon + a pure `wordDiff` fed by an additive `previousMarkdown`); expose a pure
    renderer helper from core via a dedicated lean subpath export (`@selfos/core/story-diff`), never the crypto-heavy
    barrel; and keep a moved control's accessible name stable (a decorative ✓ via CSS `::before`, not text) so
    existing `getByText`/role-name matchers don't break.\*\*
- 2026-07-17 — **Build (Your Story §13 R4 — read receipts, draft export & the export dialog; SPEC 64 §13.7 R4
  BUILT on `feat/story-sharing-export`, PR pending).** The fourth slice of the redesign, closing two audit-found
  gaps + adding read receipts. **Read receipts (§13.6.8):** a new additive `StoryReadReceipt` — the READER writes
  `people/<readerId>/story/receipts/<bookId>.enc` when they open a shared book (piggybacking on the existing
  `storyMarkSharedRead`, which already carries the author id), **re-gated inside** `writeReadReceipt` (only when
  the book is still published + still shared with them), storing the `publishedAt` they saw. The AUTHOR joins it:
  `listReaders` now reads each granted reader's receipt → a `BookReader.read` state (`{openedAt, upToDate}` or
  absent), surfaced on the Sharing tab as **"Read the latest" / "Opened <date> · older version" / "Hasn't opened
  it yet"** (`upToDate` = the reader saw the current `publishedAt`; republishing flips a stale reader to "older").
  Person-delete reaps **both directions**: the deleted person's own receipts go with `deletePerson`, and a new
  `reapReadReceiptsAbout` (wired into `peopleDelete`) removes receipts OTHER readers hold about the deleted
  author's books. **Draft export (§13.6.1):** core `buildDraftMarkdown`/`buildDraftHtml` (reuse `readOwnBook`'s
  draft head + resolve the draft image bytes) + a **`head: 'draft' | 'published'`** param (`StoryExportInputSchema`,
  default published) on `story:exportMarkdown`/`:exportPdf`, so a **never-published** book exports its live written
  chapters + the live honesty note — fixing "export trapped behind publishing". **Export dialog:** the two inline
  export buttons → one **"Export…"** (always available) opening a centered `role="dialog"` — format (Markdown/PDF)
  · version (Working draft / Published, Published unusable until shared) · the vault-boundary line. Additive schema,
  no version bump. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1433 core + 1279 desktop** unit (+receipt
  write/read/derive/reap + draft-export core; +coreBridge two-persona receipt round-trip [reader opens → author
  sees "read the latest" → republish → "older" → reap] + draft-export-without-publishing; +3 Story RTL [export
  dialog Markdown-published, PDF-draft-no-publish, the reader read-state row]), **7 story E2E** (the publish/reader
  walk now exports the DRAFT before publishing + the published PDF via the dialog, and the author's Sharing tab
  shows "Read the latest" after the reader opens). Real-Electron visual QA (the export dialog + the reader
  read-state read clean). **Lesson: a cross-person "who read my book" signal is cheapest as a receipt the READER
  writes in their OWN vault space (author-visible, re-gated on write) + an author-side JOIN in `listReaders` — no
  new channel, it rides the existing mark-read op; and a "reap both directions" on person-delete means the deleted
  person's own files go with `deletePerson` while a scan reaps the receipts OTHERS hold ABOUT them. Draft export is
  free once you have `readOwnBook` — the draft head is already the same shape the published exporter consumes, so
  it's a `head` param + a `buildDraftHead` that resolves the draft image bytes.**
- 2026-07-17 — **Build (Your Story §13 R5 — the Interview tab: life map + gaps + ask-a-gap + answered history;
  SPEC 64 §13.7 R5 BUILT on `feat/story-interview-tab`, PR pending).** The fifth slice: the Interview tab goes
  from a bare "Find what's missing" button to the full experience. **Backend:** the gap pass now **persists** its
  output so the tab renders with **no AI** — additive `StoryInterviewState.lastGaps` (each gap gets a stable `id`
  at persist time, so `askGap` can target it) + `lastPartCoverage` (per-part 0..1). The gap-pass prompt/schema
  gained a **tolerant** per-part `partCoverage` read that falls back to a **deterministic** written/reviewed ratio
  (`computePartCoverage`: reviewed = 1, written-not-reviewed = 0.5, unwritten = 0). Three reads/ops, all gated
  `story.own` + active-person-scoped: a **free** `story:gaps` (`getStoryGaps`, no AI), **`story:askGap`**
  (`askGap` — the explicit user-triggered mint from a specific persisted gap, reusing `mintStoryCheckInFromTodo`'s
  self-send path + honoring the **≤1-open-check-in** invariant: refuses while one is genuinely open, proceeds once
  it resolves), and **`story:answeredCheckIns`** (`listAnsweredStoryCheckIns` — submitted story-provenance
  assignments for the book, newest-first). **Renderer:** the rebuilt `InterviewTab` — the completeness hero + a
  **`LifeMap`** (one coverage bar per outline part + a **word** for how richly told each era is, the §9 text
  equivalent, a labelled `progressbar`) + the **"Worth telling next"** gap cards with **"Ask me about this"**
  (disabled + explained while a check-in is open) + an **"Answered"** history block; the store gained
  `gaps`/`answeredCheckIns` + `loadGaps`/`askGap`/`loadAnsweredCheckIns` (reset on person switch). The
  answered-history **chapter linkage** ("wove into <chapter>") is deferred (the field exists; deterministic-only
  now). Additive schema, no version bump. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1441 core + 1288 desktop** unit
  (+`computePartCoverage`, +`getStoryGaps` persisted/fallback, +`askGap` mint/≤1-refusal/resolve/unknown-id, +`listAnsweredStoryCheckIns`; +a coreBridge gaps→askGap→answered round-trip + Guest denial; +a Story RTL: life
  map + gap-card ask + answered history), **7 story E2E** (the living-book walk asserts the life map + a "Worth
  telling next" gap card after the pass). Real-Electron visual QA (the completeness hero, life-map coverage bars,
  gap invitations, and open-check-in state all read clean). **Lesson: making an AI-derived surface render FREE is
  about persisting the pass's output (gaps + per-part coverage) so the tab is a plain read — give each gap a stable
  id at persist time so an explicit "ask this one" can target it, and pair every model reading (per-part coverage)
  with a deterministic fallback so the map is never blank; an explicit user-triggered mint (`askGap`) reuses the
  auto-cadence's self-send path but must re-check the ≤1-open-check-in rule itself (refuse while open, proceed once
  resolved). Watch text collisions: a new "waiting in your Inbox" banner collided with an existing E2E outcome-notice
  regex — reword the new copy, don't loosen the assertion.**
- 2026-07-16 — **Build (Your Story chapters redesigned as a cover-backed card grid — mockup approved FIRST;
  SPEC 64 §3.1/§3.3; on `feat/story-chapter-cards`, PR pending; v0.30.0 released alongside).** The user asked to
  redesign the flat part/chapter list into a **grid of modern, sleek cards "like TikTok"** with the **generated
  cover image as the card background**. Showed a full **Artifact mockup** first (portrait cover-backed cards,
  dark scrim, overlaid chapter number + title + status pill, grouped by part) → **approved** → built it into the
  real book overview. Chapters now render as a responsive `auto-fill minmax(200px)` grid of **portrait cards**
  whose background is the chapter's **own illustration** (§3.8) where it has one, else the **book cover**, else a
  warm dusk-gradient fallback (never a flat blank); a bottom scrim keeps the overlaid **CHAPTER N + title**
  legible; a glass **status pill** (New/Updated/New material/Writing…/Reviewed) + a hover "Read ›"; parts get an
  eyebrow + title + count header; an unwritten shell is a calm dashed "Not yet written" card. Renderer-only —
  reuses the store's `getImageUrl`/`imageUrls` (resolves the cover + each chapter's first placement) + the
  existing `onOpenChapter`; the card stays a `<button>` carrying the title so every existing
  `getByRole('button',{name:/Title/})` test still matches. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1266 desktop**
  unit (+a card-grid RTL: part eyebrow + chapter number + status badge), **5 story E2E** (the setup walk asserts
  the "Part one" eyebrow; the 360px overflow guard passes over the grid). Real-Electron visual QA (the grid
  matches the approved mockup — PART ONE/Roots eyebrow + two cover-backed cards with glass "New" badges + CHAPTER
  1/2 titles). **Lesson: for a visual redesign, show a real mockup (an Artifact for image-heavy/immersive work,
  since the inline `visualize` widget forbids image backgrounds/gradients) and get it approved BEFORE building;
  then keep the redesign renderer-only where possible — a card that stays a `<button>` with the title as its
  accessible name doesn't break the existing role-name test suite.**
- 2026-07-16 — **Feedback + Build (a proper Story SETTINGS section — not a control jammed under Cover; story-
  specific image style + editable writing tone; user FORCEFUL; on `feat/story-settings-section`, PR pending).**
  The user (angry): jamming the global image-style control **under the Cover card** — when it governs ALL images —
  "makes any kind of sense"; there should be a **settings section for the story** to configure image, tone, etc.
  **Right.** Asked the design first (AskUserQuestion, 3 forks): a **collapsible "Story settings"** section on the
  book overview; a **story-only image style** (independent of dream images — departs from the earlier "one global
  style", the owner's explicit new choice); **all** of voice/tone/length/auto-refresh editable post-creation. Built:
  additive-optional `BookConfig.imageStyle`/`imageStyleNotes` (no migration; `generateStoryImage` prefers the book's
  own style, falling back to the global `dreams.imageStyle`); the writing config (voice/style/length/autoRefresh) is
  now **editable post-creation** via `storyUpdate` (steers future rewrites; existing chapters keep their text). A
  new **`StorySettingsPanel`** (collapsible, Writing + Images groups) on the overview; the image-style picker was
  extracted to a reusable **`ImageStylePicker`** shared by the story panel AND the dream-image `ImageStyleControl`
  (Settings → Images keeps the OpenAI model + key). Removed the control jammed under Cover. Gate green: typecheck,
  lint, format, **1414 core + 1265 desktop** unit (+`storyImageService` book-style-wins-over-global, +a Story RTL
  editing tone+image-style persists), **7 story/dream/images E2E** (the cover walk opens Story settings, asserts
  voice/tone/image-style, changes the tone). Real-Electron visual QA (a clean "Story settings" collapsible with a
  Writing group — voice/tone/length/auto-refresh — + an Images group). **Lesson: a control the user configures
  mid-task needs a COHESIVE settings AREA on the page where the work happens — not tacked under an unrelated card
  (image style under "Cover" when it's for all images); group related settings (Writing, Images) in a labeled,
  collapsible section, and make the book's creation-time config editable afterward.**
- 2026-07-16 — **Feedback + Build (two HARD durable UI rules + image-generation realtime progress + style-on-the-
  Story-page; user FORCEFUL after repeated reminders; on `feat/image-generation-progress`, PR pending).** The user
  (angry, repeat offense): (1) "ANY time AI is generating something like images or anything else, we MUST show
  realtime updates, timer, est time, etc" and (2) "the image style for stories should be visible IN the stories
  page, not only hidden deep within Settings." Captured BOTH as durable §12 rules + memories
  ([[ai-generation-realtime-progress]], [[surface-controls-where-work-happens]]). **Built (1):** a generic
  **`image:progress`** stream mirroring `story:progress` — core `generateStoryImage`/`generateDreamImage` gained an
  `onPhase('composing'|'rendering')` callback fired around the two-provider flow (Claude distill → OpenAI render);
  a new `ImageGenProgress` type + `BridgeHost.emitImageProgress`/`onImageProgress` + ipc `imageSender` binding (bound
  for the whole generation) + preload sub + webHost/test stubs; the bridge handlers emit phases keyed by a surface
  id (`story:<bookId>:cover` / `:ch:<id>` / `dream:<id>` / `photo:<bookId>:<id>`). A reusable **`ImageProgress`**
  renderer (self-contained CSS module, `prefers-reduced-motion`-aware) shows the live \*\*phase label + elapsed timer
  - ETA + an indeterminate bar** — wired into the story CoverPanel, ChapterReader "Illustrate this chapter",
    DreamImagePanel, and PhotosPanel vision (vision is single-phase, carried by the timer alone). Replaces every bare
    "Working…"/"Creating…" spinner. **Built (2):** the global `ImageStyleControl` (writing the same `dreams.imageStyle`
    setting — single source of truth) now also renders **on the Your Story book overview** under Cover, with the "used
    for every image" note. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1413 core + 1264 desktop** unit (+`ImageProgress`
    RTL [phase/timer/ETA/event-filtering], +a coreBridge assertion that a cover generation streams
    `composing→rendering→done`), **7 story/dream/images E2E** (the cover walk asserts the progressbar + live phase +
    "elapsed" render mid-generation via a new `SELFOS_FAKE_IMAGE_DELAY_MS` hook, + the Image-style control is on the
    page). Real-Electron visual QA (the cover card shows "Creating your cover — Painting the image… · 0s elapsed ·
    about 22s left"; the Image style dropdown sits under Cover). **Lesson: realtime progress is PART of building any
    AI-generation surface, not a follow-up — a single `image:progress` channel + one reusable `ImageProgress`
    component covers every image/vision surface; and a control the user needs mid-task (the image style) must be
    surfaced where the work happens, reading/writing the same global setting, not only in Settings.\*\*
- 2026-07-15 — **Build (Together: the "start a session" flow is now a centered MODAL, not an inline scroll-up bar —
  user-requested UI/UX improvement; SPEC 58 §3.3 amended; on `feat/together-start-modal`, PR pending).** The user:
  clicking a guided-practice card "displays a card section and has the user scroll up — awful UI/UX; a modal or
  pull-up is more modern and sleek." (Follow-on to #207, which had fixed the inline bar's scroll but kept the
  fundamentally clunky inline pattern.) **Process (the recurring rule):** showed a `visualize` mockup of both a
  centered modal AND a bottom-sheet pull-up, then **asked** (AskUserQuestion) — user picked **centered modal
  everywhere** + **both "New session" and the cards use the same overlay**. Built **`TogetherStartDialog`** — a
  hand-rolled `role="dialog"` overlay (the app's ChangeVaultDialog pattern; there's no Modal primitive): a scrim
  (dim + blur), a centered `Card` (max-width 460), the start form (guide blurb OR the optional topic box), Send
  invitation / Cancel, a Close (X), Esc / scrim / Cancel to close, `autoFocus` on the topic box (free) or Send
  (guide). Replaced the inline `.startBar` in `Together.tsx` (removed the #207 `startBarRef` + scroll-into-view
  effect — a centered modal is always in view) + dropped now-unused imports. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format,
  **1168 desktop** unit (the New-session RTL rewritten to assert a `role="dialog"` opens + Cancel closes), **17/17
  Together E2E** (the #207 test rewritten: a lower card opens the centered modal, `toBeInViewport`, + a 360px
  overflow guard with the modal open; every start-flow E2E — crown jewel, phase D–H, board, withdraw,
  follow-through — passes with the form now in the overlay). Real-Electron visual QA at desktop + 360px (clean,
  scrim-dimmed, centered). **Lesson: reuse the established hand-rolled dialog pattern (scrim overlay + centered
  `Card` + Esc/scrim/Cancel + `autoFocus`) — no new primitive needed; `Button` spreads props so `autoFocus` works
  but does NOT forwardRef (use `autoFocus`, not a ref); and a header Close icon + a footer Cancel both named
  "Cancel" collide in `getByRole` — label the X "Close". Watch heading-text regexes: `/Start .Title./` bakes in
  the curly quotes around the title (the `.` matches the quote) — keep the `“title”` quotes in the modal heading
  so the existing E2E matchers keep working (or the space-then-dot fails on an unquoted title).**
- 2026-07-15 — **Build (Together: completed commitments now recorded in Goals "Completed & closed" — user-requested;
  SPEC 61 §3.2/§6 amended; on `feat/together-completed-commitments-in-goals`, PR pending).** The user: a Together
  commitment marked **done** just **vanished** from the standing-only "Together commitments" list — recorded
  nowhere. **Decisions asked (AskUserQuestion):** (1) show **completed (done) only** in "Completed & closed" (not
  retired — retire is a hard removal); (2) make them **reopenable** (consistent with how completed personal goals
  reopen). Built: a new person-scoped **`listDoneAgreementsForViewer`** (refactored to share the pair-walk with
  `listStandingAgreementsForViewer` via a `keep` predicate; de-duped) + **`together:doneCommitments`** IPC (full

  lists so a mark-done / reopen moves the commitment between them). Renderer: a **`CompletedCommitments`**
  component (done rows: text + a green "Completed" tag + partner + "Open in Together" + a **Reopen** that flips it
  back to `standing` via the existing shared-ledger write-back) rendered as a **"Together commitments" subgroup
  inside the collapsed "Completed & closed" `<details>`** on `/goals`; the closed-history count + show-condition
  fold in the completed commitments (so the history shows even with no personal goals). No new schema — reuses the
  `Agreement` `done` status + the shared pair ledger. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1178 core + 1168

  (the completed "weekly date night" commitment under "Completed & closed" with the partner chip + Reopen).
  **Also fixed a pre-existing, date-fragile E2E** the run surfaced (verified it fails on clean `main` too): the
  `goals: a tracked goal…` test seeds a goal at a fixed past date that is now >21 days stale, firing the
  goal-followup **notification toast** whose text substring-collided with the goal card — scoped the assertion
  with `{ exact: true }`. **Lesson: a "mark done" that removes an item from its only list loses the record of
  follow-through — surface completed items in a "closed" history (reusing the existing status + ledger, no new
  schema) with a reopen path; and a `getByText(<goal text>)` E2E assertion substring-collides with any
  notification/recommendation that embeds that text (a stale-goal nudge fires as the calendar advances past the
  seed date) — scope goal/commitment text assertions with `{ exact: true }`.**

  "not doing anything" — the start bar opened OFF-SCREEN; GitHub issue #207; SPEC 58 §3.3 amended; on
  `fix/together-start-bar-scroll`, PR pending).** User screenshots: clicking "New session" (or a guided-catalog
  card like "Desire Mapping") showed a focus ring but nothing happened. **Diagnosed (not assumed):** the buttons
  DO fire — `openNew`/`pickGuide` set `pending` and the **deliberate start bar** renders between the Pulse and the
  sessions board — but the intended `window.scrollTo({ top: 0 })` to bring it into view is a **NO-OP**: the app
  content scrolls in the `.contentInner` container (`overflow:auto`), NOT the window. So opening the start bar
  from a card lower down (the catalog / intimacy panel sit at the bottom) left it rendered off-screen at the top,
  and the button read as dead. **The recurring window-vs-container scroll trap** (same class as #206's completion
  scroll). Fix: dropped `window.scrollTo` from both openers; added a `startBarRef` + an effect that
  `scrollIntoView`s the start bar (scrolling the real container) whenever `pending` opens — covering every entry
  (both "New session" buttons + all catalog + Desire & intimacy cards, which share `pickGuide`). **Reproduce-first
  (§6):** the new E2E asserts the start bar is `toBeInViewport()` after clicking a lower Repair-group card at a
  constrained height, and I confirmed it **FAILS with the fix disabled** (the bar opens but `toBeVisible` passes
  while `toBeInViewport` fails — exactly why a plain `toBeVisible` assertion never caught it) and passes with it.
  Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **41 Together unit** (no change), **17/17 Together E2E** (+the #207

  Angel" + Send invitation into view). **Lesson: `window.scrollTo` / `scrollTo(0,0)` is a NO-OP in this app —
  content scrolls in `.contentInner`, not the window — so any "scroll to reveal what I just opened" must use a
  ref + `scrollIntoView` on the element (the #206 lesson, now bitten twice); and a `toBeVisible` E2E assertion
  does NOT prove a just-opened element is on-screen — assert `toBeInViewport()` for open-and-reveal affordances,
  or an off-screen "nothing happened" bug sails through green.**
- 2026-07-15 — **Fix (Together sessions: "Wrap up & reflect" now visibly CLOSES OUT the session + no duplicate
  agreements + per-session ledger; GitHub issue #206; SPEC 58 §3.6/§3.8/§3.9/§4.3 + SPEC 61 §3.3 amended; on
  `fix/together-wrap-up-closes-session`, PR pending).** Three user-reported bugs, all in the couples-session
  wrap-up flow. **(1) Wrap-up didn't feel like it "ended" the session.** Diagnosed (not assumed): wrap-up already
  set `report.wrappedUp` and the status correctly derived to `complete`, and the to-do list (agreements) + insight
  report were already saved — but **`TogetherSession.tsx` had NO render branch for `complete`**, so a wrapped-up
  session rendered identically to an active one (composer fully live, reflection panel still offering "Wrap up &
  reflect"). Decisions asked (AskUserQuestion): stay on the session showing a clear "Wrapped up" state (reflection
  - to-do list front and center) + collapse the composer behind "Reopen to keep talking." Built: a `complete`
    branch — a green **"✓ This session is wrapped up · <date>"** banner (`role="status"`, scrolled into view + focus
    moved to the reflection on the complete transition), reflection + agreements ledger **above** a read-only thread,
    the turn pill reads **"Wrapped up"**, the composer collapses behind **"Reopen to keep talking"** (one tap reveals
    it; a shared message reopens the session — the existing soft-complete model). **Coherence fix (code-review
    blocker):** the retained "Reflect again & note actions" button silently **un-wrapped** the session (a `reflect`
    pass overwrote the report WITHOUT `wrappedUp` → derived back to `active` with no message) — fixed at the CORE:
    a `reflect` pass now **carries forward** an existing report's `wrappedUp`/`wrappedUpAt`, so the invariant holds
    (**only a new shared message reopens a session**). **(2) Duplicate agreements.** Root cause: `captureAgreementFromMarker`
    had NO de-dup, so the coach re-emitting the same `[[SELFOS:AGREEMENT]]` marker across turns / on a retry minted
    identical copies. Fixed: the marker path now de-dups by normalized text against the non-retired ledger (returns
    the existing twin), matching the wrap-up action-item de-dup; a shared `normalizeAgreementText` + a read-time
    `dedupeAgreements` (preferring the most-actionable twin) collapses legacy dupes on display. **(3) Cross-session
    pollution.** The per-session reflection panel + top strip showed the pair's WHOLE agreement history; now
    `togetherGetReport` scopes to `provenance.sessionId === session.id` — the pair-wide view lives on Home + Goals
    (`togetherMyAgreements`, spec 61). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1177 core + 1164 desktop** unit
    (+marker-de-dup, +`dedupeAgreements`/`normalizeAgreementText`, +reflect-preserves-wrapped-up, +2 RTL [composer

    E2E drives the real active→complete flow — partner accepts first — asserting the banner + collapsed composer +
    Reopen + a repeated marker yields ONE agreement + "Reflect again" keeps it wrapped; the spec-61 strip test
    updated to the per-session behavior). Real-Electron visual QA (the close-out reads clean; banner leads).
    code-reviewer: fix-first (both blockers applied) → clean. **Lesson: a status that derives correctly under the
    hood (`complete`) is invisible unless the detail VIEW branches on it — the fix was a render branch, not a data
    change; and a "refresh" action on a terminal state must NEVER be able to silently reverse that state (carry the
    `wrappedUp` flag forward on a reflect), or you re-create the exact "it won't stay closed" symptom. Duplicate
    records from an LLM marker need de-dup at the CAPTURE path (the coach repeats itself), not just the analysis
    path; and a pair-level ledger shown per-session must filter by `provenance.sessionId`.**
- 2026-07-14 — **Fix (Together agreements weren't top-of-mind on the dashboard — user-reported after spec 61
  shipped; SPEC 61 §3.1/§3.2 amended; on `fix/together-agreements-prominence`, PR pending).** After 61 merged the
  user (screenshot): "I'm still not seeing the together reflections appear in the dashboard, besides a little
  tag" + asked to (a) put agreements in the **needs-attention** card so they're top of mind and (b) **improve
  the Goals card** so it actually SHOWS the commitment, not just a count. **Diagnosed (not assumed):** the
  agreement needs-attention item was a **`nudge`**, so `needsAttention`'s `suppressNudges` filter (proactivity
  off **OR** crisis) dropped it — a standing commitment the couple MADE isn't an AI suggestion, so it shouldn't
  be suppressed by the proactivity dial. **Fix:** (1) the `agreement` item is now a **genuine (non-nudge) item**
  gated on a new explicit `crisis` input (added to `AttentionInput`) — it stays visible under proactivity-off,
  suppressed only under an active crisis (Home leads with support); its **detail now shows the actual commitment
  TEXT** (single agreement) so you see what it is at a glance. (2) The Home **`GoalsCard`** passive "N Together
  commitments" chip is replaced with a **"Together commitments" mini-section** — each standing agreement's text +
  partner + a one-tap **"Mark done"** (writes back via `together:setAgreementStatus`), capped at 2 with a "See
  all" → `/goals` (also fixed the card's stale "See all" → `/memory` to `/goals`). Gate green: typecheck, lint,
  format, **1154 desktop** unit (attention: single-agreement text detail + non-nudge-shows-under-suppressNudges +
  crisis-suppresses; GoalsCard: commitments text + partner + mark-done), **spec-61 E2E** extended (the commitment

  "Following through with Angel" + the commitment text prominently). **Lesson: a "clear-as-you-act" callout the
  user wants TOP OF MIND must be a genuine needs-attention item, NOT a `nudge` — nudges are for AI suggestions and
  get dropped by the proactivity-off dial; gate a concrete-commitment item on `crisis` alone, and show its TEXT

  boxes that make the page very long, not clear you can edit them." **Mockups approved FIRST** (two `visualize`
  mockups — the redesigned cards, then the top surfaces), then **decisions asked** (3 rounds, all AskUserQuestion):
  **flatten** the tile→area→single-card drill-down into **collapsible life-area sections edited in place**;
  **redesign all three top surfaces** (portrait/trends/responses); **all sections collapsed by default, sensitive

  that line** (card pencil = whole card); **reuse 57's knows-you formula**. **Renderer-only, NO new persisted

  **`Collapsible`** design-system primitive (header button `aria-expanded` + body, controlled/uncontrolled, the §12
  accordion-spacing rule baked in once) + `/gallery` + a unit test. (2) **`Memory.tsx` rewritten** from a 5-view
  switch (overview/area/insight/review/responses) into a single scrolling page: a **stats strip** (things known ·
  confidence · areas · tidied), a **collapsible review callout** (drafts + merge proposals), search, the
  **portrait hero** (`PortraitHero` — avatar + narrative + read-more + "Edit your answers"), **`TrendsCard`**
  ("How you've been", a 30d/90d/All `SegmentedControl` + `LineChart` + a §9 text read), a **`ResponsesBand`** (#129,
  per-recipient collapsibles), and collapsible **`LifeAreaSection`s** (`sections.ts` = `summarizeAreas` + a
  sensitivity flag). Deep-links open the target section + `scrollIntoView`. (3) **`InsightCard` reworked** for
  **obvious inline editing** — a card-level pencil (whole card) + a **per-line pencil per AI-inferred fact** (edits
  just that line inline; Save via `insights:update` merge-by-id so `restricted`/`shareableTypes` are preserved) +
  the per-fact scope chip + flag; the intake portrait renders as a section card with **`hideSummary`** (the hero
  owns the narrative — no duplication; portrait facts stay viewable/searchable, corrected via onboarding). Deleted
  the orphaned `InsightRow`/`LifeAreaTile`/`ConfidenceDots`. **Privacy preserved:** a related person's facts still
  never render raw; `restricted` facts only to the owner with a "private" tag; sensitive sections collapsed; crisis
  banner + footer intact. **CSS:** `.duo` now `auto-fit minmax(260px,1fr)` (stacks at narrow widths) + the panel

  editability a visible pencil (card + per-line), not a buried mode toggle; keep the intake portrait's narrative in
  the hero + its facts in a section card with the summary hidden (`hideSummary`) so nothing duplicates while the

- 2026-07-14 — **Build (Together follow-through — agreements → Goals + dashboard, session summary strip, inline
  Pulse on Home; SPEC 61 APPROVED + BUILT; on `feat/together-follow-through`, PR pending).** The "things to do" from
  a Together wrap-up (the **agreements ledger**) + the couples **Pulse check-in** were buried — agreements only at
  the very bottom of one session's reflection panel, the check-in only on the Together page. **Decisions asked
  first (3 rounds, all AskUserQuestion):** surface agreements **alongside goals** (NOT duplicated into per-person
  `Goal`s — they stay the one shared pair record); **all three pulse metrics inline** on Home; Memory redesign is a
  separate spec (mockup approved, spec 62 next). Then: pulse due at **>7 days**; agreement callout **clear-as-you-
  act** (non-dismissible nudge); Home shows **both** the needs-attention item + a passive `GoalsCard` count.
  **Slice A** (backbone): new core `listStandingAgreementsForViewer` (enumerate the viewer's pairs from
  `together/pairs/`, standing-only, resolve the partner id) + two IPC channels `together:myAgreements` /
  `together:setAgreementStatus` — **person-scoped in the bridge** (only the active person's pairs; `setAgreementStatus`
  resolves the pair from the **partner id**, robust to a deleted origin session, preserves text/timeframe/createdAt/
  provenance, only the status changes → the shared record, so both partners see it). Surfaced as a gentle
  `agreement` **needs-attention** item (`attention.ts`/`NeedsAttentionCard`, `nudge:true` so it respects
  proactivity-off/crisis + clears as agreements are marked done/retired) + a **"Together commitments"** section on
  `/goals` (`TogetherCommitments.tsx`, read + mark-done/retire, write-back via the existing shared ledger) + a
  passive roll-up on the Home `GoalsCard`. **Slice B**: a top-of-session **summary strip** in `TogetherSession`
  ("📌 N agreements · Wrap up/Jump to reflection") that focuses the reflection section (a `sectionRef` into
  `TogetherReflection`) — no more scrolling to the bottom; mirrors the reflection panel's visibility. **Slice C**:
  extracted the shared **`PulseCheckInForm`** (the "How are things with X?" head + 3 metric SegmentedControls +
  default-off lock-gated share-desire toggle + Save) from `TogetherPulse` so the Together page AND a new
  **`pulse-checkin`** recommendation (domain `together`, `together.own`-gated, additive `pulseCheckinDue` state
  signal computed in `Home.tsx`) render ONE form — inline in the "For you" band via `RecommendationItem` (a
  `hideHead` variant), calling the existing `togetherPulseLog`. **No new persisted schema, no duplication** (agreement
  = one shared record; pulse = one per-person log). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM), lint, format, **1170
  core + 1151 desktop** unit (+`listStandingAgreementsForViewer` scope/corrupt-skip, +`pulse-checkin` provider,

  a `PulseCheckIn`] → session strip shows "N agreements" → Goals "Together commitments" mark done [decrypt the

  - needs-attention item, Goals commitments section, session strip). **Lesson: a "surface it elsewhere" feature is
    cheapest as a cross-pair READ over the existing shared record + a status write that resolves the pair from the
    PARTNER id (not the origin session, which may be gone) — no duplicate per-person record, no sync problem; and
    extracting the ONE check-in form (`PulseCheckInForm`) lets Home + the feature page render identically with a

- 2026-07-14 — **Fix (Intimacy → Unfiltered tier was producing Explicit/General-level output, not truly
  unfiltered; user-reported; SPEC 08 §24.9; on `feat/questionnaire-unfiltered-intensity`).** The owner wanted the
  Unfiltered tier to actually reach its intended intensity — highly explicit, kinky, taboo, boundary-pushing:
  extreme acts + scenarios, group sex/threesomes/orgies, exhibitionism, sex/strip clubs, etc. **Diagnosed from the
  prompt assembly (NOT a refusal — the model produces content, just too tame):** the §24 personalization overhaul
  I'd just shipped added softeners that COMPETE with the explicit register — the relationship framing LEADS the
  prompt (`relationshipFraming('partner')` = "warm, intimate, us-oriented"), and `GENERATION_SYSTEM` gained the
  set-arc ("open with lighter questions … close warm") + the "gentle and reassurance-aware" personality directive.
  Those fight "no restraint anywhere," so the model split the difference. Fix (within the UNCHANGED consensual-adult
  / in-policy boundary — the `SAFETY` prefix + never-minors/never-illegal/taboo-only-as-roleplay clauses are
  untouched): (1) strengthened `EXPLICIT_TIER_DIRECTIVE.unfiltered` to NAME the extreme content the tier is meant to
  reach (hardcore kink/BDSM/power-exchange, rough/edge play, group sex — threesomes/orgies/gangbangs/swinging/
  cuckolding, exhibitionism/voyeurism/public sex/sex clubs/strip clubs/play parties, taboo fantasy/roleplay);
  (2) `explicitFraming` now emits a GOVERNING-OVERRIDE line so the explicit register OVERRIDES any "warm/gentle/
  tender/open-with-lighter-questions/build-rapport-first" guidance — every question frank + explicit from the
  first, no gentle warm-up — plus an extra unfiltered "the most extreme … make it filthier … never dilute into
  tasteful/romantic" line. The ladder is preserved (`explicit` a step back; `intimacyGeneral` non-graphic). Gate
  green: typecheck, lint, format, **1151 core** unit (topics.test asserts the extreme directive + governing
  override reach the model; §22 explicit-vs-unfiltered ladder still distinct). **Live-model intensity verification
  needs a real key — an on-device DoD item (§22.3); the offline fake returns canned output, so the units assert the
  prompt ASSEMBLY, not the model's output.** **Lesson: a strong tier directive (unfiltered) gets SWAMPED by
  general personalization directives (relationship warmth, the "open lighter" arc, "gentle" personality) added
  later — the same swamping the brief hit in §23; make the tier register GOVERN the tone with an explicit override,
  and name the specific extreme content so "unfiltered" isn't left to the model's default restraint.**
- 2026-07-13 — **Build + DURABLE PRIVACY OVERRIDE (questionnaire AI: use ALL the data — complete de-dup + deep
  personalization + question intelligence; SPEC 08 §24 BUILT; on `feat/questionnaire-ai-deep-personalization`).**
  After the §23.5b fix, the user (frustrated my audits kept missing data) demanded a genuinely exhaustive re-audit
  ensuring EVERYTHING is covered + ALL data is used, plus improvements/enhancements. Ran **3 parallel deep-audit
  agents** (full data inventory · generation-coverage verification · personalization/intelligence) + verified the
  critical claims myself. Root finding: generation has **two asymmetric data paths** — de-dup (onboarding + asked
  prompts) and tailoring (only `notes`+`tags`+bare relationship type) — each drawing from a DIFFERENT subset, so
  the same field (occupation) was used only as a "don't re-ask" avoid-list, never to personalize. **Verified gaps:**
  prior-questionnaire ANSWERS never read (spec §19.1 unimplemented + a stale comment); session/dream/test/Together
  insight facts EXCLUDED from the semantic de-dup reference (re-askable); ~20 rich `Person` fields + relationship
  closeness + relationship-type-as-register unused for tailoring; topic map only themed intimacy. **Decisions
  asked + locked:** all-in-one · read RAW prior answers · all four enhancement groups. **Track A** (never re-ask):
  `gatherRecipientPriorAnswers` (raw Q→A) + `gatherRecipientInsightFacts` fold into a relevance-prioritized
  `dedupReference` (onboarding + prior Q→A lead, then insight facts, then prompts), cap 12000→16000. **Track B**
  (deep personalization): rich-profile tailoring, `relationshipFraming(type, closeness)` (partner≠coworker≠child),
  recipient name/pronouns, broadened topic map, psych-profile-aware directive. **Track C**: set-arc +
  answer-type-intent rubric in `GENERATION_SYSTEM`/`ANSWER_TYPE_GUIDE`. **THE PRIVACY OVERRIDE (durable, owner's
  informed decision):** the user directed that questionnaire TAILORING use **ALL** of the recipient's data —
  shareable AND private/restricted. I did NOT silently comply: I spelled out the exact consequence (a member's
  private health/trauma/intimacy data can shape + be implied by the visible questions another member authors,
  overriding spec 15/42/43 + CLAUDE.md §1's "highly sensitive, never surface to others") via AskUserQuestion; the
  owner chose "All data, always" fully informed. So questionnaire generation now feeds the recipient's private/
  locked profile fields + relationship notes — **scoped STRICTLY to questionnaire generation** (`contextProviders`
  - `recipientKnownData`); `buildContext` (coaching), Memory's cross-user gate, Together `excludeRestricted`, and
    every other surface are UNCHANGED (their privacy tests stay green). The §17.4 author-blind boundary still holds
    for de-dup (only questions come back). Same pattern as the 2026-07-11 Together pre-screen removal: surface the
    trade-off, let the owner decide, comply + document. See memory [[questionnaire-tailoring-uses-all-data]]. Gate
    green: typecheck, lint, format, **1124 core + 1116 desktop** unit (+relationshipFraming/recipient-framing,
    +rich-profile-feeds-locked-notes, +`gatherRecipientPriorAnswers`, +bridge decrypt: session fact reaches the
    pass author-blind), **24 questionnaire E2E**. code-reviewer + release: pending. **Lesson: personalization and
    de-dup are two sides of the SAME data — feed the recipient's complete profile + history ONCE and instruct the
    model to BOTH build on it (personal, go deeper) AND never re-ask it; and a "use ALL data" directive that
    overrides a privacy boundary must be an INFORMED owner decision (spell out the exact leak, then comply + scope
    it to the one path), never a silent default. Also: parallel deep-audit agents (data inventory + coverage
    verification + enhancement lenses) + verifying the critical claims yourself is how you avoid the shallow-audit
    miss the user rightly called out.**
- 2026-07-13 — **Fix (Draft-with-AI STILL re-asked onboarding questions — the semantic de-dup pass never saw the
  onboarding answers; user-reported [threesome MMF/FFM, an intake `pornGenres` answer]; SPEC 08 §23.5b; on
  `fix/questionnaire-onboarding-dedup`).** After §23 merged, generation kept asking questions the app already has
  data for. **Diagnosed from the code (not assumed):** the onboarding answers ARE gathered
  (`formatIntakeForGeneration`) but reached de-dup two broken ways — (a) the generation prompt got them as SOFT
  grounding (the model ignores it, the §23 premise); (b) the **semantic pass** (the only layer that catches a
  differently-worded re-ask) got them inside the `recipientHistory` blob **truncated to 3000 chars**, and
  `recipientKnownData` appended the onboarding answers **LAST**, after `gatherRecipientHistory` (profile + 15
  insights×5 facts + 40 asked prompts) which alone exceeds 3000 chars — so the pass **never saw the onboarding
  answers**. Fix: a **dedicated, prioritized `dedupReference`** (bridge → `generateQuestions` → the pass) that
  **LEADS with the full onboarding answers** (specific acts/positions/genres/MMF-FFM/yes-no) then the asked
  prompts; the reference budget **raised 3000 → 12000**; the semantic-pass system prompt made **stricter** (drop a

  "when in doubt, DROP"); and the **onboarding question prompts join the hard fuzzy filter** (`formatIntakeForGeneration`

  subset-containment [gated ≥2 content words] / Jaccard ≥0.6) drops built questions near-duplicating the draft, the
  kept set, OR the recipient's already-asked prompts (`gatherRecipientAskedPrompts` threaded host-side). **Slice 4:**
  `semanticDedup.ts` — a bounded, metered (`questionnaire.dedup`), **fail-safe** second Claude call (keeps ALL on
  AI-off/over-budget/parse-miss/empty-list; author-blind — only keep/drop indices return) that catches meaning-level
  dupes the fuzzy layer misses; `generateQuestions` over-asks a +3 buffer when a recipient has history, runs the
  pass, trims to the requested count. `runClaude`/`AiDeps` extracted to `aiCall.ts` (re-exported) to break the
  `generationService`↔`semanticDedup` cycle. **Slice 5:** the inline "Add a consensual-adult topic" field removed
  from the panel (managed only in Settings → Intimacy topics); the materialize path also gets the de-dup + semantic
  pass. **Privacy boundary unchanged** (§17.4 author-blind: the recipient's known content still crosses only
  host-side, never returns; the semantic pass sends a bounded ≤3000-char digest, returns only indices). Code-reviewer
  **fix-first** (both should-fixes applied: actually import `runClaude` from `./aiCall` so the cycle is truly broken;
  gate subset-containment at ≥2 content words so a single shared topic word isn't hard-dropped [+test]; the privacy/
  fail-safe/over-ask-trim/count-bounds/metering all verified sound). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM), lint,
  format (only the pre-existing `site/index.html` untouched), **1117 core + 1114 desktop** unit (+`dedup` [8], +`semanticDedup` [4], +generation count-scaling/hard-drop/semantic-integration, +panel count/declutter RTL, +a
  bridge count+hard-drop decrypt test), **19 questionnaire E2E** green (the authoring draft asserts the count Select
  defaults to 5 + is choosable + the topic field is gone; the intimacy-topics test asserts the inline add is gone);
  real-Electron visual QA of the panel (count Select sits cleanly between the brief + Generate). **Lesson: a brief
  that's "wired but ignored" is a prompt-PRIORITY bug, not a plumbing bug — make it the LEADING, governing FOCUS so
  the forceful de-dup/explicit blocks apply within it instead of swamping it; and layer de-dup CONSERVATIVELY (a
  fuzzy filter that rarely false-drops — single-word overlap is NOT a dup) + a bounded, FAIL-SAFE semantic pass
  (over-ask a buffer, trim after) so meaning-only paraphrases get caught without ever losing the author's questions
  or dead-ending.**
- 2026-07-13 — **Build (message timestamps across every AI chat surface; mockup approved first; specs 01 §5.6 +
  05 §3; on `feat/msg-timestamps`, a git worktree, PR pending).** The user asked to show, below each message,
  when it was sent/received — everywhere the user chats with AI. Showed an interactive `visualize` mockup (a
  format toggle: time-only / relative / date+time, + a hover-only option) and **asked the three forks** — the
  user confirmed all recommendations: time + a day divider, **always visible**, **all four surfaces**
  (Sessions, Together, Dream analysis, Onboarding intake) — then, on review, asked to **also show the DATE on
  each message** (keeping the divider) so a long single-day thread doesn't require scrolling up to the divider
  to see the date, so the per-message meta is a **short date + time** ("Jul 13 · 3:42 PM"; the year only for a
  prior year). **Render-only — NO schema change:** every message already stores `ts` (`ChatMessage.ts` /
  `TogetherMessageView.ts`), so this reuses it. New shared design-system primitives + pure helpers:
  **`MessageTime`** (a muted `<time>` below a bubble — short date + time, side-aligned, renders nothing for an
  unparseable ISO), **`MessageDayDivider`** ("Today" / "Yesterday" / same-year weekday+date / prior-year
  full date, a `role="separator"`), **`MessageRow`** (wraps a bubble + its timestamp, owning the 80% width cap +
  sender-side alignment so the plain-bubble surfaces share one layout; a `.row > :first-child { max-width:100% }`
  override neutralizes each surface's own bubble max-width **without editing it**), and `formatMessageTime` /
  `formatDayLabel` / `dayDividerLabel` (unit-tested). A divider shows at the top of a thread and whenever the day
  changes from the previous SHOWN message (Sessions filters the pre-05 §4.1 blank ghost first, so the "previous"
  is never a hidden ghost); an in-flight (streaming / "thinking") bubble carries no timestamp. Together renders
  the timestamp INSIDE its header-carrying bubble (bottom-aligned start); the other three wrap each bubble in
  `MessageRow`. Added a `/gallery` "Message timestamps" section (DoD §12). code-reviewer **fix-first** — the two
  substantive findings (time-only vs the requested date+time; a loose format test) were **already resolved**
  before the review (the date+time refinement landed first); applied the 3 nits: wrapped the onboarding static
  opener + the "Listening…" indicator in `MessageRow` (width parity with every other coach bubble + consistency
  with Sessions/Dreams), rendered the leading day divider **above** the opener (from the first message's ts) so
  the day leads the thread, and `aria-hidden` the divider's visible label so a `role="separator"` with an
  `aria-label` isn't announced twice. Divider logic, the CSS override strategy, blank-ghost filtering, and the
  Together aside projection were verified correct. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1063 desktop unit**
  (+`messageTimeFormat` [13: same-year date+time / prior-year year / Today/Yesterday/weekday/unparseable/
  divider], +`MessageTime` RTL [7]), **E2E** (the sessions send-a-reply test asserts a `<time>` + the "Today"
  divider render in the real built app). Real-Electron visual QA of the Sessions thread (muted "Jul 13 · 12:27 PM"
  below each bubble, right under the user's / left under the coach's — matches the approved mockup). **Process:** a concurrent
  session was editing the SHARED working tree (uncommitted Together WIP — `TogetherCatalog` mid-edit referencing
  a not-yet-created `./PracticeCard`, plus `TogetherPulse`/`Together.module.css`/core `together/*`/`schemas.ts`),
  which broke the Together unit tests in the shared checkout. Branching alone does NOT isolate the working tree —
  so I moved my 13 disjoint files into a dedicated **`git worktree`** off `origin/main` and ran the whole gate
  there, clean. **Lesson: every AI chat message already carries `ts`, so a "when was this sent" affordance is
  pure rendering — one shared `MessageRow`/`MessageDayDivider` pair (the row owns width+alignment, a
  `> :first-child` override caps the bubble) lets all four surfaces adopt it without touching their bubble CSS;
  and when another session shares the checkout, a `git worktree` off origin/main is the only way to gate your
  work free of their uncommitted churn.**
- 2026-07-11 — **Change + durable decision (Together pre-screen REMOVED at the owner's request; spec 58 §8.2;
  on `fix/together-remove-prescreen`).** The user asked to remove the couples "A private check-in, just for you"
  pre-screen. Because it was the app's **couples safety gate** (the AI-free, per-partner screen for
  safe-being-honest / afraid-of-partner / coerced signals that held an at-risk person from a first session and
  surfaced crisis resources — a documented non-negotiable per CLAUDE.md §1 / spec 58 §8.2), I **flagged the
  safety trade-off + asked** (AskUserQuestion, 3 options: one-tap-skippable / remove-entirely / lighten) rather
  than silently delete an IPV/coercion safety net. The owner chose **remove entirely**, informed. Surgical full
  removal: `PreScreenForm`, `preScreen.ts`/`.test`, the `PreScreenResult`/`TogetherPreScreenView`/`Result`/
  `SubmitSchema` schemas + `people/<id>/together/prescreen.enc` storage, the `together:prescreenGet`/`Submit` seam
  (channels/ipc/preload/test-utils/coreBridge), the gate on `together:create`/`accept`/`sendMessage`/`retry`, the
  `PRESCREEN` failure-reason union member, the store's prescreen state/actions, and `PRESCREEN_INTRO_LINE`. The
  invitation flow is now **ceremony → accept** (no screen). **What deliberately STAYS (verified untouched):** the
  always-present **crisis footer** on every Together surface, the in-session **escalation/coercion handling** in
  the couples prompt (§8.5 — the coach still slows a flooded exchange + routes to support), the aside/
  confidentiality logic, and `excludeRestricted` — the removal drops only the _pre-session_ screen, not the
  in-conversation safety behaviour. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1082 core + 1043 desktop** unit (the
  pre-screen unit/RTL/coreBridge tests deleted, not skipped), **11/11 Together E2E** (the crown-jewel ceremony→
  accept flow confirms no screen in between), real-Electron visual QA of the Together home (goes straight to
  "Start a session"). code-reviewer **ship** (removal clean + complete, no dangling refs, safety mechanisms
  provably intact; swept the flagged dead `.prescreen*` CSS + 5 stale comments). Synced spec 58 §8.2 (→ REMOVED
  note, original design kept for history) + §3.4/§5.2 + the header. **Lesson: when a user asks to remove a
  feature that is a documented SAFETY mechanism (here IPV/coercion screening), surface the trade-off + the exact
  scope and let them decide with AskUserQuestion — don't silently comply OR refuse; and when they confirm, remove
  it SURGICALLY (only the pre-session screen), leaving the in-conversation crisis/coercion handling + the crisis
  footer intact.**
- 2026-07-11 — **Build (Together — couples sessions; SPEC 58 Phase H BUILT — integrations; SPEC 58 IS NOW
  BUILT ACROSS ALL PHASES A–H; split into 3 merged PRs; autonomous overnight, spec defaults taken).** The final
  phase, sub-sliced for reviewability. **H1 (`feat/together-integrations`, PR #160):** the Home
  **`together-session` RecommendationProvider** (53) — the pure `computeTogetherHomeNudge` derives one nudge
  from the viewer's session summaries, prioritized **invite → your-turn → quiet(>14d)**; capability-gated
  `together.own` (added to Home's reactive capability snapshot, the 52 silent-death lesson), signal-aware
  `dismissKey` keyed on the stable `pairKey`; a **quiet nudge is suppressed while the same pair has an in-flight
  session** (no "it's been a while" mid-session), and a person with any Together session is **no longer "brand
  new"** so a pending invite surfaces in "For you". Plus **person-delete reap** (`reapTogetherForPerson` removes
  the deleted person's session folders + pair agreement/report dirs, called from `peopleDelete`; per-person data
  already goes with `deletePerson`; the live-edge re-gate keeps partner-side orphans unreadable).
  `computeTogetherHomeNudge` lives in `@selfos/core/recommendations` (not the host-only `together` barrel) so the
  renderer imports it cleanly. **H2 (`feat/together-challenges`, PR #161):** **joint challenges** — additive
  `Challenge.groupId`; a `[[SELFOS:CHALLENGE:{…}]]` marker on a **non-aside** couples turn → `captureJoint
ChallengeFromMarker` mints a twin per partner via the reused 52 `captureFromMarker` (per-person files, one shared
  `groupId`, a same-session re-mint updates the twins); each twin flows into that partner's existing 52 Home card
  - check-in + reflection→Insight; `JOINT_CHALLENGE_INSTRUCTION`; `jointChallengeGroundingLines` (counts **people
    not records**); a self-hiding `TogetherJointChallenges` home tile via `together:jointChallenges` (gated +
    live-edge). **H3 (`feat/together-suggestions`, PR pending):** the **SUGGEST artifact** — a `[[SELFOS:SUGGEST:
{kind,prompt,guideId?,topic?}]]` marker on a non-aside reply → a **write-once** `TogetherSuggestion` under the
    session (one writer — the coach turn — so §4's one-writer rule holds; no dismiss/mutation), parse/strip wired
    into the shared `stripCoachMarkers`; the `TogetherSuggestions` card **NEVER auto-acts** — a `guide` →
    **"Start this exercise"** (starts a new Together session, but ONLY a real **non-adult** catalog entry; an
    adult/unknown guide degrades to a plain prompt card, and `togetherCreate` re-refuses an adult guideId host-side
    — the 18+/explicit gates hold), a `questionnaire` → **"Open a check-in"** (a doorway to the existing,
    user-confirmed Questionnaires compat flow, never a new auto-send); `SUGGEST_INSTRUCTION`; `together:
suggestions` (participant + live-edge gated). **H3 also fixed a pre-existing leak (code-review B1):** the
    Together **streaming** bubble rendered raw coach markers → now `stripCoachMarkers(streaming)`, mirroring
    Sessions. **Gate (H1–H3):** typecheck/lint/format; **1094 core + 1047 desktop** unit; **12/12 Together E2E**
    (the whole-flow coherence walk: invite→ceremony→thread→aside→wrap-up→catalog→desire/YNM→pulse→home-nudge→reap→

    code-reviewer per slice (H1 fix-first: incoherent-quiet-nudge; H2 fix-first: count-people-not-records; H3
    fix-first: the streaming-marker leak + a degraded-guide card action + a prefix-partial strip). **Two items
    flagged for a maintainer with a real Claude key: the §13 live-model adversarial pass (offline fakes can't run
    it), and the optional direct in-app compat "Send to both" from a suggestion card (H3 ships the safe
    builder-doorway).** **Lesson: any surface that renders STREAMING model text must strip coach markers on the
    live stream, not just the persisted text — a trailing marker flashes to the author mid-stream otherwise (the
    Together thread had this latent since Phase B; the SUGGEST work surfaced it). And a Home nudge that can say
    "it's been a while" must be suppressed while the same pair has a live session, or it contradicts the current
    state (the §7 coherence rule).**
- 2026-07-11 — **Build (Together — couples sessions; SPEC 58 Phase G BUILT — Pulse, absorbs spec 11; on
  `feat/together-pulse`, a git worktree, PR pending — autonomous overnight, spec defaults taken).** The Pulse
  phase (§3.10a): a couples **dyad-metric trend** + a frictionless **1–3-tap check-in** + a **dual-consent
  desire alignment**. Core **`pulseService`** — `logPulseCheckIn` (writes `people/<logger>/together/pulse/
<pairKey>/<id>.enc`, one writer per file, metrics clamped 0..1, drops an all-non-finite log), `buildPulseView`
  (the viewer's OWN check-in trends [connection/desire/satisfaction, Low/Steady/High → 0/0.5/1] + the viewer's
  OWN wrap-up-twin Connection/Friction for the pair [Phase D, ±1 → 0..1] — **never the partner's raw metrics**),
  and **`desireAlignment`** — the one comparative that reads the partner, gated on **dual consent**: surfaced
  only when BOTH partners have a `desire` reading they each consented to share (`shareMetrics ∋ 'desire'`), with
  the **most-recent desire check-in's consent governing** (logging a fresh check-in without sharing desire
  **retracts** visibility — the intuitive privacy model), reading `aligned` (|Δ| ≤ 0.25) or `some distance`; the
  two raw desire values cross the seam only for a consenting pair, and the viewer's own-desire short-circuit runs
  BEFORE any partner read. Bridge `together:pulse`/`together:pulseLog`, gated `together.own` + a re-checked
  **live partner edge** (a non-partner reads an empty view). Renderer **`TogetherPulse`** card on the Together
  home (per eligible partner; `LineChart` trends capped at 480px + a **§9 text equivalent** naming each series'
  direction, the 1–3-tap `SegmentedControl` per metric + a default-off "share my desire level" switch + the
  alignment banner). Additive schema (`PulseCheckIn`/`PulseSeries`/`PulseAlignment`/`TogetherPulseView` +
  `PULSE_METRICS`/`PULSE_METRIC_LABELS` — the single source of truth the trend assembly AND the check-in UI both
  derive from). **Spec 11 marked Superseded-by 58 §3.10a** (never built standalone; its metrics vocabulary
  adopted verbatim; `CheckIn` → `PulseCheckIn`, a fresh type — no migration). Code-reviewer **ship** (the privacy

  cross-pair isolation, path safety; applied both should-fixes: the §9 direction text equivalent is now rendered,
  and the metric list is derived from `PULSE_METRICS` in both places [no triplication]; + the stale-comment + `as
number` nits). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1067 core + 1037 desktop** unit (+pulse core [dual-consent/

  alignment surfaces; own-trend renders while alignment hidden pre-dual-consent; 360px guard). Real-Electron
  visual QA at desktop (light/dark) + 360px (the card, the check-in form, the alignment banner). **Phase H
  remains** (integrations: joint challenges, questionnaire→compat→alignment grounding, Home together-session
  provider, quiet-session offer, person-delete reap, whole-flow coherence walk + visual QA sweep). **Lesson: a
  dual-consent comparative must be retractable via the MOST-RECENT reading (not a lingering older opt-in), and the
  viewer's own-side consent must short-circuit BEFORE the partner's file is ever read — so "I stopped sharing"
  takes effect the instant the next check-in lands, and a non-consenting viewer can never force a partner read.**
- 2026-07-11 — **Build (Together — couples sessions; SPEC 58 Phase F BUILT; on `feat/together-explicit-ynm`, a
  git worktree, PR pending — autonomous overnight, spec defaults taken).** The sixth + most safety-critical
  Together phase: the **explicit register + Desire & intimacy + Yes/No/Maybe (§3.10/§3.10b/§6.3).** The 18+
  **`together-desire` catalog group** (4 adult entries — Sensate Focus, Yes/No/Maybe-together, Desire Mapping,
  Fantasy Exchange, all `adult:true`, each leading with the not-therapy `frame()`). **`allAdultAcknowledged(fs,
key, participantIds)`** — the app's first **N-party 18+ conjunction**, true only when EVERY participant's
  shared guidance-prefs `adultAcknowledged` is set. **`EXPLICIT_INTIMACY_REGISTER`** (the frank-but-bounded 52
  `CHALLENGE_INTIMACY_REGISTER` sibling, adapted for two partners) is appended to the couples prompt **ONLY when
  both acked**, AFTER the addendum + context + grounding, before FORMATTING — SAFETY never loosened, the consent
  boundary verbatim (consenting adults only · taboo only as fantasy/roleplay · never minors/real-non-consent/
  illegal · a hard no from EITHER partner is absolute · trauma-aware STOP-and-route). **YNM (§3.10b):** a
  **symmetric, revocable** opt-in (`people/<id>/together/ynm/<pairKey>.enc`, one file per person per pair) + a
  **deterministic, no-AI mutual overlap** (`computeYnmOverlap` — the intersection of both partners' intake
  `activities` ratings at ≥ "curious" [value ≥ 3 on the 5-point scale], resolved to labels); **one-sided answers
  are NEVER revealed**, and the overlap is computed ONLY under the **full conjunction** (both 18+ acks + both
  opt-ins + a LIVE edge), **re-checked on every read** (a revoke or a removed edge re-gates immediately). The
  overlap feeds the grounding pack **only for a desire-group session when ready** (the §8.6 consented
  restricted-exception). **All withholding is host-side:** `togetherCatalog()` returns adult cards only when the
  active person acked + ≥1 live-edge partner acked; `togetherCreate` **re-checks `allAdultAcknowledged([initiator,
partner])`** for any adult guide regardless of what the catalog showed (no wrong-partner bypass); the couples
  turn computes `allAdultAcked` fresh per turn. Bridge (all gated `together.own` + participant-scoped via the live
  edge): `together:catalog`/`acknowledgeAdult`/`ynmStatus`/`ynmOptIn`/`ynmRevoke`/`ynmOverlap`. Additive schema
  (`YnmOptIn`, `TogetherYnmStatus`/`TogetherYnmOverlap`, `TogetherCatalogEntry`) — no bumps. Renderer: the
  `TogetherIntimacy` card (18+ ack → "waiting for your partner" → YNM opt-in/revoke → the mutual list + "Start
  Yes/No/Maybe together"; the `youAcked`/`eligible`/`ready` states from the bridge, never the inventory).
  Code-reviewer verdict **SHIP** — every safety boundary traced airtight (register never reaches a prompt without
  both acks; the desire group/adult guide never startable without both acks; a one-sided YNM answer never
  revealed via the overlap OR grounding; the gate is live; the trust boundary holds; `youAcked` leaks no
  inventory) — no blockers; applied the spec-lockstep should-fix (YNM storage) + two hardening nits (typed
  `IntakeSession | null`; a defensive edge re-check in the reusable grounding pack). Gate green: typecheck, lint,
  format, **1060 core + 1033 desktop** unit (+ynm/adultGate/register/overlap/opt-in-revoke core, +2 coreBridge
  two-persona [desire+adult-guide withheld until both ack; YNM symmetric + one-sided-never-shown decrypt +

  Phase F ack matrix: desire withheld → both ack → group appears → a desire session's captured prompt carries
  the explicit register → YNM opt-in/revoke through the UI + 360px). Real-Electron visual QA at desktop (the
  desire group + the YNM consent card). Synced spec 58 §4 (YNM storage as-built) + §14. **Product sign-off
  pending (§3.13):** the YNM status surfaces the PARTNER's ack/opt-in state to the viewer (never the inventory)
  to drive the actionable copy — flagged for the user. **Phases G–H remain; the §13 live-model adversarial pass
  [first run + the explicit re-run] is a manual DoD item needing a real API key — flagged for the user.**
  **Lesson: the N-party 18+ conjunction must be re-checked at EVERY explicit surface independently — the catalog
  gate is deliberately coarse (shows adult cards if the active person + ≥1 partner acked), so `togetherCreate`
  RE-CHECKS `allAdultAcknowledged([initiator, partner])` for the actual pairing (a wrong-partner bypass is
  refused at create), and the couples turn computes `allAdultAcked` fresh per turn — never trust an earlier
  gate. And a "restricted reaches no one" exception (the YNM mutual overlap) is only safe as a DETERMINISTIC
  host-side intersection gated on the FULL conjunction (both acks + both opt-ins + live edge, re-checked every
  read) that emits only the BOTH-≥-curious subset — one-sided answers never computed into the result, revoke
  deletes the opt-in file so the next read is instantly not-ready.**
- 2026-07-11 — **Build (Together — couples sessions; SPEC 58 Phase E BUILT; on `feat/together-catalog`, a git
  worktree, PR pending — autonomous overnight, spec defaults taken).** The fifth Together phase: the **guided
  couples catalog (§3.10).** New **`togetherCatalog.ts`** — `together-connect` + `together-repair` groups (8
  entries: Love Maps, State of the Union, Appreciation Exchange, Dreams Within Conflict; Naming Your Cycle,
  Repair After a Rupture, Four Horsemen, Speaker & Listener), **SEPARATE** from the solo `guidedCatalog` (16) so
  solo surfaces never list couples guides and `GuidedGroupId`/`GUIDE_LIFE_AREAS` stay untouched; the 18+
  `together-desire` group + its entries land in Phase F. The **`adult === (group === 'together-desire')`**
  invariant is tested. A guided couples session is an ordinary Together session carrying **`guideId`**:
  `createSession` seeds the guide's **static opening message** (no model call, a shared coach message);
  `buildTogetherSystemPrompt` resolves the guide from `session.guideId`, foregrounds its group's life-areas, and
  appends the **guide addendum** (leading with the not-therapy `frame()`) + (structured) the **`[[SELFOS:STEP:n]]`
  step convention** AFTER context + grounding, before FORMATTING. The couples turn **stamps the coach-declared
  step** onto the message (additive **`TogetherMessage.guideStep?`**) — **never on a private aside** (§3.6) — and
  strips the marker from the visible text; the **current step is DERIVED** from the newest coach message
  (`guideStepFor`), so session.enc stays single-writer. **The 18+ group is withheld HOST-SIDE:** `togetherCatalog()`
  returns only `allowAdult:false` cards in Phase E, and `togetherCreate` refuses an adult/unknown `guideId` (never
  merely a hidden UI card). Additive view fields (`TogetherGuideView`/`TogetherCatalogEntry`, `TogetherSessionView.guide?`/`guideStep?`).
  Renderer: the grouped, **searchable** `TogetherCatalog` on the Together home (picking a card binds it to the
  start form; the topic field hides for a guided start) + a structured **stepper** in the thread (current step
  `aria-current`). Bridge `together:catalog`. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **1054 core + 1028 desktop**
  unit (+8 core catalog [adult invariant, unique-id/opener/frame, host-side withhold, guide resolution, opener
  seed, addendum+step-convention order, derived step, no-step-from-aside], +1 coreBridge [guided create seeds
  opener + resolves guide view + derives step via marker + chat-no-stepper + unknown/adult refused], +2 RTL
  [catalog group/search/pick, structured stepper]), **6/6 Together E2E** (+E2E: start a structured guided session
  from the catalog → the stepper renders → a "move to step two" turn advances the derived step [marker never
  shown, decrypt asserts `guideId`] + 360px catalog/stepper overflow guard). Real-Electron visual QA at desktop
  (the grouped catalog + the thread stepper). Synced spec 58 §14. **Phases F–H remain; the §13 live-model
  adversarial pass [first run] is a manual DoD item needing a real API key — flagged for the user.** **Lesson:
  keep the couples catalog a SEPARATE module (`togetherCatalog`), not a group bolted onto the solo `guidedCatalog`
  — the solo `GuidedGroupId` union + life-area map + every solo surface stay untouched, and the couples prompt
  builder resolves `guideId` against the Together catalog ALONE; and derive the structured-exercise step from the
  newest coach message's stamped `guideStep` (parse the marker, stamp the message, strip the text) rather than
  storing it on session.enc, so the single-writer invariant holds — never stamp from an aside.**
- 2026-07-11 — **Build (Together — couples sessions; SPEC 58 Phase D BUILT; on `feat/together-wrapup-memory`, a git
  worktree, PR pending).** The fourth Together phase: **wrap-up & relationship memory (§3.8/§3.9).** **Owner
  decisions asked first (§11 #2):** agreement editing = **inline on the ledger** (each field editable in place,
  LWW); a **gentle, dismissible follow-up** offered when an agreement is marked **done** (a soft editable "build
  on it?" prompt — never a nag). **Wrap-up (`togetherAnalysisService.runTogetherWrapUp`):** one metered
  **`together.analyze`** pass, **initiator-billed**, over the **mutually-visible transcript only** — every
  `privateAside` message is **excluded host-side before prompt assembly** (a code boundary, decrypt-tested absent
  from the report AND both twins); **crisis routed away from the shared report** (`crisisFlag` lands on the
  affected partner's twin only; the report stays supportive/detail-free); **meter-before-parse**; **idempotent
  re-run** (reuse-the-id). It writes a **`SharedReport`** (both partners see) + **per-partner twin insights**
  (`source:'together'`, subject = that partner, feeding ONLY their own context; `provenance.togetherSessionId` +
  the stable `pairKey`; `relationshipId` = the live edge). **Twin subject resolution is fail-safe:** strict
  name→id match, and **NO twins are written when the two partners share a display name** (can't disambiguate → never
  mis-subject a reflection — a code-review should-fix). **The twin is SPLIT (the other code-review should-fix):**
  the MAIN twin (reflection + non-sexual facts, no `restricted`) feeds the partner's context in **every** topic;
  a companion **INTIMACY twin** (sexual facts, `restricted` + **`lifeArea:'Intimacy'`**) is own-context-only +
  intimacy-topic-gated — because the §50 relevance-gate is **fail-closed on a missing `lifeArea`**, so a single
  unlabelled restricted fact on the main twin would have silently withheld the WHOLE reflection from the partner's
  coaching. **Agreements ledger (§3.9):** the pair-level ledger is the **one two-editor record** (either partner
  edits/retires; last-write-wins; an edit preserves `createdAt` + origin provenance); captured live via the
  **`[[SELFOS:AGREEMENT:{json}]]`** marker (parsed on **non-aside** turns only — asides mint no shared artifacts,
  §3.6 — and **globally stripped** by `stripCoachMarkers`, so a solo coach that ever emits one never shows it).
  **Grounding pack v2:** standing agreements + the last wrap-up summary (relational continuity, not sexual detail,
  §8.6). **Renderer:** `TogetherReflection` (a "Wrap up & reflect" CTA gated on AI+memory, the shared report card,
  the inline-editable ledger, the gentle done-follow-up), wired into `TogetherSession`. **Additive schema (no
  bump):** `InsightSource` gains **`'together'`** (the 3 Memory `Record<InsightSource>` maps extended);
  `InsightProvenance` gains `togetherSessionId?`/`pairKey?`; new `SharedReport`/`Agreement`. Bridge:
  `together:wrapUp`/`:getReport`/`:saveAgreement` (gated `together.own` + participant-scoped via
  `accessibleTogetherSession`; Together memory rides the existing `sessions.memoryEnabled` toggle — no dead new
  setting). Code-reviewer **fix-first** (both should-fixes above + nits). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format,
  **1046 core + 1025 desktop** unit (+16 core wrapUp [aside-exclusion, twin-split feeds-context, crisis-routing,
  restricted intimacy companion, identical-names guard, idempotency, marker capture/skip-on-aside, grounding v2],

  staleness + non-participant refused], +4 RTL), **5/5 Together E2E** (+E2E #5: wrap-up report + twins + aside
  absent [decrypt] + agreement capture via the marker through the UI + done-follow-up + 360px). Real-Electron
  visual QA at desktop. Synced spec 58 §14 + spec 05 §4.1 (Phase C). **Phases E–H remain; the §13 live-model
  adversarial pass [first run] is a manual DoD item needing a real API key — flagged for the user.** **Lesson: the
  §50 memory relevance-gate is fail-CLOSED when a `restricted` fact has no `lifeArea` — so putting a couples twin's
  sexual fact on the SAME insight as its reflection silently withholds the whole reflection from the partner's
  coaching (the feature's core value) in every topic; split sexual facts onto a separate `lifeArea:'Intimacy'`
  companion so the reflection always feeds while the sexual detail stays own-context-only + intimacy-gated. And a
  strict name→id twin match still mis-subjects when two participants share a display name — the map collapses and
  the guard's "unresolvable" branch never fires; detect the collision up front and write no twins.**
- 2026-07-10 — **Build (Together — couples sessions; SPEC 58 Phase C BUILT; on `feat/together-prep-attachments`, a
  git worktree, PR pending).** The third Together phase: **private prep spaces + Together image attachments + the
  secrets policy (§3.7/§6.1/§8.7).** **Prep spaces:** each participant gets their OWN private prep thread — an
  ordinary **05 Conversation** carrying a new additive-optional **`Conversation.togetherSessionId`** link (no
  `schemaVersion` bump), so it reuses the composer/streaming/retry/attachments wholesale; `prepService.openPrepConversation`
  is find-or-create with a **static opener** (no AI spend); `PrepPanel` reuses the solo `conversationStore` + shared
  `Composer` + `MessageAttachments`; **billed to its author** (its `chatStream` bills the active person, outside the
  initiator-pays rule). The solo **Sessions list (`conversationsList`) now filters `!togetherSessionId`** so a prep
  thread never surfaces there (regression-tested both directions). **Attachments:** a Together-OWN seam
  (`together:storeAttachment`/`getAttachment` + `isTogetherAttachmentPath` + `messageOwningAttachment`), distinct
  from the 45 solo channels; the couples prompt gains **vision `ContentBlock`s** (`buildTogetherClaudeMessages` now
  async: reads each stored attachment, skips missing/corrupt, merges consecutive same-role). **The privacy gate
  (§5.2):** an attachment referenced ONLY by a private aside is readable by the **aside's author alone** — the
  bridge `togetherGetAttachment` **fails CLOSED** (`!owner || (owner.privateAside && owner.authorPersonId !== me)` →
  null), path-confined to the session's attachments dir, mime/size re-validated in core. **Secrets policy (§8.7):**
  `TOGETHER_ADDENDUM` gains the **identical no-oracle deflection** ("I keep each of your private reflections
  private — I'd tell you the same thing either way"), no covert use of a private note, and no indefinite
  secret-holding. Code-reviewer **fix-first** (the fail-open→**fail-closed** aside gate — the security-critical
  gate the feature hangs on; + nits: dropped the dead `bytes` store field, bounded the base64 input). Gate green:
  typecheck, lint, format, **1030 core + 1016 desktop** unit (+prepService/attachment core [prep find-or-create +
  own-thread isolation, store round-trip, mime/size reject, path guard, `messageOwningAttachment`], +3 coreBridge
  [prep off the Sessions list both directions, aside-attachment refused for the partner + **owner-less orphan fails
  closed**, non-participant refused, unsupported mime], +2 RTL [Prep-privately affordance, secrets-policy addendum
  phrases]), **4/4 Together E2E** (#2 extended: attachment stores encrypted under the session namespace + decrypts
  to PNG + the prep space stays OFF the Sessions list; the crown-jewel prompt-capture now asserts the deflection
  phrase reaches the live prompt), real-Electron visual QA at desktop + 360px (thread with "Prep privately" +
  attachment thumbnail; the prep panel; the `.threadHead` now wraps at 360px so the new button never overflows).
  Synced spec 58 §14 + spec 05 §4.1 (additive `togetherSessionId` amendment). **Phases D–H remain; the §13
  live-model adversarial pass [first run] is a manual DoD item needing a real API key — flagged for the user.**
  **Lesson: a privacy read-gate keyed on "the owning message flags this as an aside" MUST fail closed on an
  unknown owner (`!owner → null`) — an owner-less orphan (stored-but-never-sent attachment) has bytes on disk and
  is indistinguishable from a shared image except by its owning message, so a fail-OPEN default would resolve it
  for anyone the moment its uuid path leaked; and a prep space is just a solo Conversation carrying a
  `togetherSessionId`, so the ONE thing that keeps it private is the Sessions-list `!togetherSessionId` filter —
  test it both directions.**
- 2026-07-10 — **Build (Together — couples sessions; SPEC 58 Phase A + Phase B BUILT; on `feat/together-foundation`,
  a git worktree, PR pending).** The first two phases of the new top-level **Together** feature — async,
  invitation-based, AI-facilitated couples sessions. **Owner decisions asked first:** the pre-screen flag rule =
  **conservative** (flag on any not-safe-being-honest / afraid / pressure signal; "often afraid" adds crisis
  resources; "prefer solo first" offers the route but isn't a hard flag), and **all four §11 spec defaults kept**
  (prep bills its author, wrap-up excludes asides from all artifacts, non-attributed pause, desire-continuity
  resets per session). **Phase A (backend):** `@selfos/core/together` — session/message/state CRUD + the
  **viewer-projection derivations** (`deriveStatusFor`, `projectMessages`, `turnStateFor`, `unreadCountFor`,
  `digestFor`) that make every viewer signal (status/turn/unread/snippet/notification) privacy-safe; capability
  `together.own` (Member ON); the bridge seam gated on `together.own` + participant membership + a **LIVE partner
  edge** re-checked on every read/write, every read viewer-projected (the trust boundary); 2 notification kinds.
  **Phase B (AI + surface):** the **code-enforced `excludeRestricted`** option (threaded `buildContext` →
  `summarizeForContext` → drops every restricted + sensitive-life-area fact from the couples prompt, incl. the
  pinned portrait's; default-off = solo byte-identical); the **AI-free pre-screen** (outcome-only storage, raw
  answers never persisted, the one §5.2 gate); the **couples turn** (`togetherPromptBuilder`: PERSONA+SAFETY →
  facilitator addendum → per-participant confidentiality contract + `excludeRestricted` context → grounding pack
  [syntheses + latest alignment] → FORMATTING; `runTogetherTurn`/`retryTogetherReply` = the 05 §4.1 invariants,
  **initiator-billed**, **aside turns → private coach reply + no artifacts**; `together:chunk` streaming); asymmetric
  budget honesty (the partner gets a neutral session notice, no ratio/$); the renderer (store, `/together` +
  `/together/session/:id`, nav gated on `together.own` + a live edge, home/start-flow, the ceremony [rules of the
  room DERIVED from mechanics, **mechanical-never-absolute** §8.7], the pre-screen form, the author-attributed
  thread + private-aside composer, two notification providers). **Tests:** 40 core + 14 coreBridge integration
  (two-persona: quiet-decline projection, aside hidden from partner, budget asymmetry, edge-delete re-gating) + 15
  RTL/unit + **3 E2E** (the crown jewel: an aside is invisible in the partner's rendered thread while present in the
  captured prompt [restricted-absence + register-absence + contract-order asserted], decrypt-level; the pre-screen
  hold + no-raw-answers; gates + 360px). New E2E fakes: `SELFOS_FAKE_PROMPT_DIR` capture hook, a Together fake-Claude
  branch, `SELFOS_FAKE_TOGETHER_EMPTY`. Gate green post-rebase onto latest main: typecheck/lint/format, \*\*1025 core
  - 1002 desktop** unit, 3 Together E2E; real-Electron visual QA at desktop (light/dark) + 360px + the ceremony.
    **Phases C–H remain** (prep spaces/attachments, wrap-up/memory, catalog, explicit register/YNM, pulse,
    integrations). **Lesson: every viewer-facing signal must be computed over the viewer's PROJECTION, never raw
    files — one `projectMessages`/`deriveStatusFor` that both list and single-read derive from is what makes a
    quiet-decline invisible to the initiator and a private aside invisible to the partner across status/turn/unread/
    snippet/notification at once; and the restricted-exclusion for a shared-output prompt has to be a code path
    (`excludeRestricted` through the context builders), not a prompt instruction, because the existing store gates
    keep a subject's own restricted facts IN their own intimacy-topic context and the portrait bypasses the gate.\*\*
- 2026-07-10 — **Build (Questionnaire Preview & Results redesign — SPEC 08 §20 slice 5/5 BUILT: private results —
  SPEC 08 §20 IS NOW FULLY BUILT; on `feat/questionnaire-private-results`).** The final slice (§20.8), which brings
  the private-send experience together. A private send's Results card stops being a one-line dead end and gets all
  **four** improvements: (1) a **calm privacy-explainer panel** (accent-tinted lock: "You see the insight drawn
  from {name}'s answers — never the raw answers themselves"); (2) the **numeric ratings the sender is allowed to
  see** as read-only bars (a new core `extractNumericAnswers` → additive `SendResult.numericAnswers` of
  `{prompt,row,value,min,max}`, numbers only — the §8.4/§13.5c boundary the trends read already honors, so a private
  card shows real signal instead of "hidden"); (3) a **prominent primary "Analyze to see the insight"** CTA on an
  un-analyzed private send (secondary for a Standard send whose answers already show); (4) the **drafted Insight
  INLINE** — additive `SendResult.insightSummary`/`insightId` (populated in the bridge for any analyzed send) render
  through the shared landing **`InsightExcerpt`** with a **deep-link to the exact insight in Memory** (router
  `{ insightId }`), replacing the bare "review in Memory" banner. **The raw written answers still NEVER cross the
  bridge for a private send** (unchanged §8.4) — a bridge decrypt-level test asserts `answers` stays undefined while
  `numericAnswers`/`insightSummary` are present and the prose is absent from the serialized result. Gate green:
  typecheck, lint, format, **983 core + 11 relay + 973 desktop** unit (+`extractNumericAnswers` numeric-only /
  no-text; +bridge private-send numeric+insight / never-raw; +2 Results RTL [explainer+numeric+Analyze, inline
  excerpt+Memory link]), **E2E** (the private responses-arrived test now asserts the explainer + "Ratings you can
  see" + the numeric, prose absent; the answer-review test asserts the inline excerpt + View-in-Memory after
  analyze/re-analyze; fixed a latent slice-4 assertion ambiguity — the aggregate band duplicates a prompt on the
  Standard view, scoped with `.first()`), real-Electron visual QA at desktop (the private card: lock explainer +
  "Rate it" bar at 4/5, no raw prose). Synced spec 08 §20 (→ **FULLY BUILT, all 5 slices**). **Lesson: a private
  send's Results card can show REAL signal without breaking the boundary — surface the derived Insight (summary +
  id) + the NUMERIC answers only (the same data trends already exposes), never the written/categorical content; the
  bridge stays the trust boundary (it decrypts host-side and emits only numbers + the insight), so `answers` stays
  undefined and the raw prose never reaches the renderer. And when a new cross-recipient band (the aggregate)
  duplicates a question prompt already shown in a per-recipient list, existing `getByText(prompt)` E2E asserts go
  strict-mode-ambiguous — scope them to `.first()`.**
- 2026-07-10 — **Build (Questionnaire Preview & Results redesign — SPEC 08 §20 slice 4/5 BUILT: the aggregate
  "At a glance" read; on `feat/questionnaire-results-aggregate`).** The fourth slice (§20.7) — the **one new
  backend piece**. New crypto-free view type **`QuestionnaireAggregate`** (`@selfos/core/schemas`; a proper
  DISCRIMINATED UNION — `Base & (union)` doesn't narrow via `Extract`/switch, so each member carries the base
  fields) + a pure **`buildQuestionnaireAggregate`** (`@selfos/core/questionnaires/aggregate.ts`, mirroring
  `buildQuestionTrends`): per question → a **distribution** (choice/yesNo/thisOrThat), a **numeric average**
  (rating/slider, positioned against the DECLARED scale not the observed range), **per-row/bucket averages**
  (matrix/allocation), or a **response count** (free-text/date/ranking). **The privacy rule (§8.4), tested at the
  bridge:** categorical distributions count **Standard sends only** (a Private recipient's selection is raw
  content); numeric averages fold in **BOTH** Standard + Private (numbers already reach the sender's trends,
  §13.5c); free-text is a bare count. New IPC **`assignments:aggregate(questionnaireId)`** through the full seam
  (channels → coreBridge → ipc → preload → test-utils), **sender-scoped + `questionnaires.viewResults`-gated**,
  computed in the bridge from the DECRYPTED responses (host-side) — only the aggregate crosses IPC, never a
  written answer. Renderer: the `resultsStore` loads it alongside results/trends; an **`AtAGlance`** band (token
  CSS bars; every count/average shown as TEXT, §9; "N answered privately (not shown)" when a distribution's
  standard count is short of the response count) renders between the per-recipient cards and Trends,
  self-hiding when empty. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **980 core + 11 relay + 970 desktop** unit
  (+aggregate dist/avg/rows/count + the numeric-only-private / categorical-standard-only privacy split;
  +bridge decrypt-level privacy + viewResults gating; +2 AtAGlance RTL), **E2E** (the results test asserts the
  "At a glance" average band; the inbox privacy E2E unchanged), real-Electron visual QA at desktop (the average
  bar reads "3.5 · scale 1–5"). Synced spec 08 §20.7. **Remaining: slice 5** (private results — inline insight,
  numeric distributions, Analyze CTA, explainer). **Lesson: a discriminated union defined as `Base & (A|B|…)`
  does NOT narrow — TS sees the intersection as one non-union type, so `Extract<…,{kind}>` and `switch(kind)`
  both fail; distribute the base into each member (`(Base & A) | (Base & B) | …`) for clean narrowing. And a
  numeric-average bar must be positioned against the question's DECLARED scale (1–5), not the observed min/max
  of the answers, or "3.5" sits at the wrong place and the label reads a misleading range.**
- 2026-07-10 — **Build (Questionnaire Preview & Results redesign — SPEC 08 §20 slice 3/5 BUILT: Results
  restructure — hide-when-empty + summary band + status grouping; on `feat/questionnaire-results-restructure`).**
  The third slice (§20.6). **Hide the Results tab until there's a send:** the builder's Edit/Preview/Results
  segment + render are gated on `showResults = saved && canViewResults && isSent` (isSent = a send state exists),
  and the responses-arrived deep-link only starts on Results when `sendStates[id]` exists (loaded atomically with
  the def, so no race) — the old empty "you haven't sent this yet" card is GONE. **Summary band:** a new pure
  `resultsSummary.ts` (`summarizeSends` → recipient/answered/awaiting/inProgress/declined counts + responseRate;
  `groupSendsByStatus` → ordered non-empty groups Answered · In progress · Awaiting · Declined · Closed, with a
  `?? 'closed'` fallback so every `AssignmentStatus` lands somewhere) drives a `ResultsSummaryBand` (stat tiles +
  a response-rate ring with the % as text, §9). **Status-grouped per-recipient cards:** `StandardResults` renders
  the SendCards under `ResultGroupHead`s; each SendCard header gained the landing `Avatar`. Carries **no raw
  answers** (operates only on the already-derived `SendResult[]` — the Standard/Private boundary from the bridge
  is unchanged; the private treatment is slice 5). `CompatibilityResults` untouched. Code-reviewer **ship
  after 2 should-fixes** (both applied): the summary band no longer flashes "0 recipients" during the async load
  (gated on `!loaded`), and the band's **"awaiting" tile now mirrors the "Awaiting" group exactly** (sent/opened
  only) with a separate "in progress" tile — fixing an awaiting-vs-Awaiting count collision on one screen (the §7
  coherence-walk rule); + the nits (comment direction, a full-`AssignmentStatus`-coverage test). Gate green:
  typecheck, lint, format, **974 core + 11 relay + 965 desktop** unit (+resultsSummary grouping/summary/coverage;
  Results renders-nothing-empty / summary+grouping; the builder Results-tab hidden-without-sends / shown-with-sends),
  **E2E** (the results test asserts the summary stat + the Answered group + a **360px overflow guard** on
  full-width Results), real-Electron visual QA at desktop (summary band + response-rate ring + status groups +
  avatar cards + the slice-2 redesigned answer rows). **Remaining slices 4–5** (the `assignments:aggregate` read +
  "At a glance" · private results). **Lesson: a summary tile and its matching card-group heading must count the
  SAME statuses — folding `inProgress` into a band "awaiting" while the "Awaiting" group excludes it makes "2
  awaiting" collide with "Awaiting (1)" + "In progress (1)" on one screen (§7); mirror the groups exactly. And a
  view that renders derived counts must gate on the store's `loaded` flag or it flashes zeros for a frame before
  the async load resolves.**
- 2026-07-10 — **Build (Questionnaire Preview & Results redesign — SPEC 08 §20 slice 2/5 BUILT: modernized
  answering form + progress + "Your answers" review; on `feat/questionnaire-answering-modernize`).** The second
  slice (§20.5). **Progress indicator:** an additive **`progress?`** prop on the shared `@selfos/answering`
  `QuestionnaireForm` (default OFF) → a slim top bar (`role="progressbar"` + answered/total-visible aria + a text
  "N of M answered") + a **"Question N of M" eyebrow** per card, **numbered in RENDER order** (ungrouped first,
  then each group, so numbering matches what the person sees even for grouped forms) via the pure `isAnswered`/
  `visibleQuestions` core helpers. Wired ON at the **two answering hosts only** — `InboxAnswer` + the relay
  `RelayApp` — so Preview (disabled), onboarding (`IntakeFormPanel`), and the self-tests (`TestTake`) stay plain
  (default off). **Modernized controls (token CSS only, so the in-app Inbox AND the external relay page both get
  it — §5.4):** taller inputs (36→42px), rounder question cards (`--radius-md`→`--radius-lg`) with airier padding,
  bigger tap targets on scale points + pills (min-height 44px), softer option cards. **"Your answers" review:**
  the shared `AnswerList` (`.qaList` — used by Results, the Inbox review, the compat report, break-glass reveal)
  redesigned into divider-separated prompt→answer rows (prompt a quiet label, answer below). Code-reviewer
  **ship** (no blockers/should-fixes; applied the a11y nit — `aria-hidden` on the visible progress label so the
  progressbar's aria-label isn't read twice; the "answered counts optional questions too" is the intended
  answered/total-visible semantics). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **974 core + 11 relay + 959 desktop**
  unit (+progress on→bar+numbers / off→none), **E2E** (the inbox answering asserts the progressbar + "Question 1
  of" + the count updating on answer; 23 questionnaire/inbox/compat + 21 onboarding/self-test E2E green — the
  shared-form CSS change caused no geometry regression), real-Electron visual QA at desktop (the modernized
  answering form with progress + the redesigned "Your answers" review). **Remaining slices 3–5** (Results
  restructure · aggregate read · private results). **Lesson: number a progress indicator in RENDER order, not the
  `visible`-array order — a grouped form renders ungrouped-first-then-groups, so mirror that exact traversal when
  building the number map or "Question N of M" won't match what the person sees; and keep the whole progress UI
  behind a default-off prop so the ONE shared renderer stays plain for its non-answering hosts (Preview,
  onboarding, self-tests).**
- 2026-07-10 — **Spec + Build (Questionnaire Preview & Results redesign — SPEC 08 §20 APPROVED; slice 1/5 BUILT:
  full-width detail + disabled Preview; user-requested; mockup + 2 AskUserQuestion rounds FIRST; on
  `feat/questionnaire-full-width-preview`).** A complete rethink of the read-and-review half of questionnaires
  (Preview · answering/"your answers" · Results). Reviewed the whole surface, built an interactive `visualize`
  mockup (4-view switcher: Preview · Answering · Results-visible · Results-private), then locked **8 decisions**
  with the user: full-width EVERYTHING incl. the Edit builder · **Preview = disabled only** (test-on-self removed
  — the author built the questions, self-answering makes no sense) · modernize the answering form for BOTH the
  in-app Inbox AND the shared relay page · a progress indicator · Results = summary + aggregate + per-recipient ·
  **hide the Results tab until there's a send** · closed-type aggregates with free-text as a count · and **all
  four private-results improvements** (inline insight excerpt + View in Memory · numeric mini-distributions ·
  prominent one-tap Analyze · a calm privacy-explainer). Wrote spec 08 **§20** (§20.3–§20.13 + the 5 build
  slices). **The one new backend piece (slice 4): `assignments:aggregate`** — a derived per-question read that is
  **numeric-only for Private sends** (reusing the exact boundary the trends read already honors, §13.5c/§8.4), so
  no new exposure. **Slice 1/5 BUILT:** dropped the `max-width:760px` cap on `.page[data-view='detail'] .detail`
  (every surface spans full width, §20.3); an additive **`disabled?`** prop on the shared `@selfos/answering`
  `QuestionnaireForm` wraps the questions in a **`<fieldset disabled>`** (natively disables every descendant
  control incl. the custom `<button>`s, no per-control wiring) with the **crisis footer OUTSIDE** it so "Get help
  now" is never disabled (§8.2) + `min-width:0` on the fieldset (a disabled fieldset defaults to `min-content` →
  would force an inner scrollbar, §12); `QuestionnairePreview` rewritten to a static disabled render (removed the
  answers state, Finish, required-validation, and the `readOnly` prop — all of test-on-self), naming the bound
  recipient. Code-reviewer **ship** (no blockers/should-fixes; applied the nit — pass the plain recipient name,
  guarded by a resolved recipient, so an unbound draft falls back to the generic note instead of "what no one yet
  sees"). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **974 core + 11 relay + 957 desktop** unit (QuestionnaireForm
  disabled/inert + crisis-still-works + no-onChange; Preview disabled + recipient-named + no-Finish; the builder
  preview RTL asserts disabled), **E2E** (the old test-on-self test rewritten to a disabled-Preview + full-width
  360px overflow guard), real-Electron visual QA at desktop + 360px. **Known limitation (documented, §20.4):** a
  static disabled preview shows the initially-visible (unbranched) questions — branch-gated follow-ups are visible
  to the author in Edit. **Remaining slices 2–5** (answering modernization + progress · Results restructure ·
  aggregate · private results). **Lesson: `<fieldset disabled>` is the low-surface-area way to make a whole
  shared form read-only — it propagates `:disabled` to every descendant control (custom `<button>`s included) with
  zero per-control threading; keep the crisis footer OUTSIDE it (§8.2) and set `min-width:0` (a disabled fieldset's
  `min-content` default otherwise overflows a flex parent, §12).**
- 2026-07-10 — **Build (Questionnaires landing cards state whether answers are private or visible — card privacy
  badges; user-requested; mockup approved FIRST [visualize widget, 3 placement variants + AskUserQuestion forks:
  status-row chip · both Sent AND Received · mode-specific compat labels — all recommended picks]; spec 08
  §3.1/§3.3; on `feat/questionnaire-card-privacy`).** Every landing card now carries a quiet **privacy chip**
  beside the status pill (icon + short label; the full honest sentence as the tooltip): Sent = `Private · insights
only` (lock, accent tint) / `Answers visible` (eye, neutral outline) / `Mixed privacy` (legacy multi-recipient
  whose latest sends differ); Received = `Your answers stay private` / `<Sender> sees your answers` — shown on a
  **New** card too, so the recipient knows what the sender sees BEFORE opening. A **compatibility** card states
  its **visibility mode** (`Combined report` / `Report + own answers` / `You see all answers` / `Shared with
<sender>` / `Context only`) since a generic "Private" would misstate `senderSeesAll`. Drafts/never-sent show no
  chip (privacy is chosen at send). Data: additive `QuestionnaireSentOverview.privacy?: PrivacyMode | 'mixed'`
  (derived in the bridge with the SAME per-recipient latest-send dedup as the recipient chips) +
  `InboxItem.compatibilityVisibility?` (read from the frozen snapshot); the Sent compat chip reads the definition
  (`questionnaire.compatibility.visibility`), so it shows even without `viewResults`. **Honesty guard (§8.4):** the
  Received tooltips reuse `externalSendDisclosure` VERBATIM — and per the code-reviewer's should-fix, the Inbox
  answering pane's plain-send disclosure was unified ONTO `externalSendDisclosure` (its inline strings deleted), so
  the pane, the relay page, and the chips share one derived source; the two name-free compat tooltips
  (`senderSeesAll`/`contextOnly`) are pinned byte-for-byte against `compatibilityDisclosure` by a drift-fence unit
  test. Route-local pure `privacyBadge.ts` + a shared `PrivacyChip` (title tooltip, ellipsis-safe at 360px). Gate

  compat-visibility-on-InboxItem, +privacyBadge matrix incl. the verbatim pin, +2 RTL [Sent chips + exactly-3/

  a private foreign send → asserts both Sent chips, the Received chip on a New card, 360px overflow guard; the
  inbox round-trip asserts the unified disclosure wording); real-Electron visual QA at desktop + 360px. Synced
  spec 08 §3.1/§3.3/§6. **Lesson: a per-send attribute surfaced at card level must be derived with the SAME dedup
  the card's other fields use (latest send per recipient), with an honest `mixed` fallback; and when a chip
  paraphrases a privacy promise, wire its wording to the one derived disclosure source (reuse verbatim + pin with
  an equality test) — a hand-copied sentence WILL drift, and the §8.4 guard only holds if every surface prints the
  same derivation.**
- 2026-07-09 — **Fix + redesign (Questionnaires Sent card: the Insight excerpt was "weirdly cut off"; user-reported;
  mockup approved FIRST; spec 08 §3.1; on `fix/questionnaires-insight-excerpt`).** Four connected defects in the
  analysed card's excerpt: (1) `-webkit-line-clamp: 4` sat on the PADDED `.excerpt` box, so overflow clipped at the
  padding edge and a **half-sliced sliver of the 5th line** rendered into the bottom padding; (2) the "View in
  Memory →" button was inline AFTER the summary INSIDE the clamped box — **clipped out of existence** on any long
  summary; (3) the AI summary rendered as a raw string (literal `**` marks — every other AI-prose surface uses the
  spec-34 `<Markdown>`); (4) "View in Memory" dumped the user on the Memory landing, not the insight. **Redesign
  (Calm; the user picked "Show more + Memory deep-link" from the mockup):** a route-local **`InsightExcerpt`** —
  an "Insight" eyebrow + the summary through the shared `<Markdown>` **clamped to 3 whole lines on a padding-free

  affordance INSIDE the clamped element (a long text clips it away exactly when it's needed) — clamp a padding-free
  body and give actions their own row; and a clamp geometry E2E must seed text long enough to overflow at FULL grid
  width (a lone auto-fit card stretches to the whole row, un-clamping a summary that clamps at normal card width).**
- 2026-07-08 — **Enhancements on the Questionnaires landing (11 user asks, mockup iterated + approved FIRST;
  spec 08 §3.1/§3.3; on `feat/questionnaires-page-redesign`, stacked on the base redesign commit).** After the
  two-section redesign, the user requested a batch of upgrades; I mocked them ALL up in an interactive Artifact
  (Calm direction), iterated twice on feedback ("analyze button + toolbar look out of place" → quiet ghost
  toolbar + a soft accent Analyze prompt; the green re-send box "looks out of place" → a calm accent nudge that
  keeps the age visible + frames refreshing as good), got "looks good," THEN built. **Sections are collapsible;
  "Sent" is organised into collapsible status subgroups** (Drafts [dashed] · Awaiting · Answered · ready to
  analyze · Analyzed) via a pure `sentGrouping.ts` (`sentStatusOf`/`SENT_GROUPS`/`sortSent` — favourites pin
  top). Each section has a **quiet toolbar** (search + status filter + sort) + **"Show more"** pagination. Cards
  now show **date AND time** (`formatDateTime`). **Sent card**: favourite · **share-link** (icon+tooltip, moved
  out of the kebab) · **view** ("See what was sent") icons + a kebab (**Duplicate**/Delete), an **inline delete
  confirm** rendered IN the card (fixing the off-screen section-banner confirm — the "can't delete a sent one"
  report was the confirm being scrolled away), a one-tap **Analyze** on answered-not-analysed (reuses
  `insights:analyze`), the **Insight excerpt** + "View in Memory" once analysed, and a calm **"these answers are
  N old — duplicate & send for fresh answers"** nudge when stale. **Received card**: **category eyebrow**,
  received/answered **date·time**, and a **favourite** (device-local per-person via `InboxItem.favorite` +
  `assignments:setFavorite` + `DeviceState.inboxFavorites`, the `discoveryDismissals` precedent). Additive
  `sentOverview` fields (`answeredAt`/`analyzed`/`insightSummary`/`analyzableAssignmentId`) — still **no raw
  answers** cross the seam (the excerpt is the sender's own derived Insight summary). Gate green: typecheck,
  lint, format, **972 core + 11 relay + 934 desktop** unit (+sentOverview new-fields + inbox type/favorite/

  collapse/filter]), **E2E** (redesign test extended: grouped statuses + date·time + Analyze affordance +
  received category + favourite-flip + section collapse; real-Electron visual QA at desktop + 360px). **Lesson:
  a `getByText('Awaiting response')`/`('New')`/`('Submitted')` collides once a status FILTER `<option>` with the
  same word exists AND a group LABEL shares the prefix — scope to `{exact:true}` or a role button, and remember
  InboxAnswer's Submit calls `onDone` (returns to the landing), so post-submit assert the card's new "View" CTA,
  not a status pill that now shares text with the filter option.**
- 2026-07-08 — **Redesign (Questionnaires landing → a two-section card grid; user asked, mockup approved FIRST;
  spec 08 §3.1/§3.3; on `feat/questionnaires-page-redesign`).** The old page was a master list + a big empty
  "Select a questionnaire" detail placeholder (wasted real-estate the user flagged). Replaced with a full-width,
  responsive **two-section card grid**: **"Sent"** (your authored questionnaires — type eyebrow, title,
  favourite, **recipient chips with per-person answered state** [✓/⏱], a rich status pill [`Awaiting response` /
  `N of M answered` / `Answered · analysed` / `Draft · not sent`], a **"N new"** un-reviewed-responses badge, a
  `Ready to re-send` nudge) and **"Received"** (questionnaires others sent you — sender avatar, status pill, a
  state-matched CTA Answer/Continue/View; the standalone `/inbox` nav stays per the user). Each section self-hides
  when empty; opening a card drops into the full-width builder or the shared answering pane; `closeDetail`
  refreshes both stores on return so a card reflects what just happened. **Process:** reviewed the CURRENT code,
  then showed an interactive `visualize` mockup with a Calm↔Bold toggle; user picked **Calm** + confirmed 4 forks
  (both looks shown, responsive grid, keep Inbox nav, rich per-recipient status) BEFORE any code. **Decisions
  asked up front, not guessed.** New backend: **`questionnaires:sentOverview`** read (sender-scoped, gated
  **`questionnaires.viewResults`** — recipient detail is results territory, stricter than the create-gated
  `sendStates`; deduped to each recipient's LATEST send with a deterministic answered-wins tiebreak on an exact
  timestamp tie; the sender's own **compatibility** half excluded [only when `compatibilityGroupId` set — a plain
  self check-in stays]; **NEVER** the raw answers — the privacy boundary holds). Additive `InboxItem.fromSelf`
  (senderPersonId === recipientPersonId) filters a **self check-in** out of the page's Received section (it
  already shows under Sent) so no card double-renders on one screen; `/inbox` still lists it. Route-local
  `SentCard`/`ReceivedCard`/`Avatar` (theme-safe accent-subtle initials — colored per-person avatars can't hold
  contrast across light/dark) + a shared `inbox/inboxStatus.ts` (`receivedStatus`/`receivedCta`, DRY with the
  Inbox route). No new design-system primitive → no `/gallery` change. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **972
  core + 11 relay + 925 desktop** unit (+`sentOverview` bridge [recipients/answered/new-counts/viewResults-gate/
  sender-scope], +`fromSelf` assert, +2 Questionnaires RTL [rich Sent card, Received section + open-to-answer]),

  sections + the rich statuses + self-send NOT double-shown + answer-from-card round-trips [decrypt] + 360px
  no-overflow incl. inner scrollers; updated `author-scoped`/`lifecycle`/`compatibility`/`re-asks` for the new
  layout). Visual QA: real Electron screenshots at desktop + 360px (Calm cards, recipient ✓/⏱ chips, pills, "N
  new" badge; single-column reflow, no overflow). Synced spec 08 §3.1/§3.3/§6. **Lesson: a self check-in (you're
  both sender + recipient) legitimately lands in your own Inbox, so once Sent + Received share one screen it
  double-renders — a derived `fromSelf` flag filters it from Received (it lives under Sent); and a per-recipient
  "latest send" dedup must be deterministic on a timestamp tie (rapid programmatic sends collide in one ms) —
  prefer the answered send so the card reflects real engagement regardless of iteration order.**
- 2026-07-08 — **Fix (Memory: a questionnaire YOU sent a partner was mislabelled "About you"; GitHub issue #129;
  user-reported with a screenshot; specs 08 §13.4 + 54 §3.2; on `fix/memory-questionnaire-responses-section`).**
  An analysis Insight from a questionnaire the viewer **sent to someone else** keeps `subjectPersonId` = the
  **sender** (it correctly informs the sender's coaching), but its facts describe the **recipient's** answers —
  so Memory's "About you" life-area cards showed it with the eyebrow "Questionnaire · About you" (the user:
  "it's obviously about my partner"). **Decisions asked first (2 forks, user-chosen):** a dedicated **"Responses
  to your questionnaires"** section (not the Partners tab, not just a relabel); scope = **all sent + any
  recipient** (standard sends AND compatibility alignments; household + external). **Display-only fix — subject
  stays the sender, `summarizeForContext`/`buildContext` untouched.** Added additive-optional
  `InsightProvenance.aboutPersonId` (household recipient) / `aboutName` (external) — **no `schemaVersion` bump**;
  stamped by `analyzeAssignment` (from `assignment.recipient`) + `generateAlignment` (the other participant),
  **never for a self check-in** (recipient = sender). A shared **`aboutResolver`** (`aboutFromRecipient` +
  `resolveInsightAbout`) also resolves it **read-time** in `coreBridge.insightsList` for pre-#129 insights (join
  the assignment / compat group), so the user's EXISTING confusing insight moves without a re-analyze. Memory
  groups these by recipient in their own labelled section (out of the life-area cards); the `InsightCard` eyebrow
  reads **"From `<name>`'s answers."** **Also fixed a pre-existing §12 overflow the new prominent card surfaced:**
  a broadcast fact's sharing chip listed all 8 relationship types in a non-wrapping row → `describeScope` now
  returns "everyone you relate to" for the full set (matches the SharingPanel copy), the `.factItem` row wraps,
  and the `RelationshipScopePicker` chip caps + ellipsizes. Gate green: typecheck (all), lint, format, \*\*972 core

    with the "From Angel's answers" eyebrow, absent from life-area cards; a legacy insight resolved read-time; 360px
    overflow guard). Visual QA: real Electron screenshot of the Responses section — grouped by recipient, eyebrow
    fixed, compact sharing chip. Synced spec 08 §13.4 + spec 54 §3.2. **Lesson: an insight can belong to person A's
    memory (`subjectPersonId`) yet be ABOUT person B — the Insight model has no "about" field, so a sent-questionnaire
    insight's facts (about the recipient) read as "about you" unless you stamp/resolve the recipient
    (`provenance.aboutPersonId`) and group by it; keep it display-only (subject + context unchanged). And a new,
    prominently-rendered card can surface a latent §12 overflow living in a shared control (a chip listing all 8
    types) — fix the intrinsic width at the source (concise label), since `max-width`/ellipsis can't shrink
    max-content.\*\*
- 2026-07-08 — **Fix + redesign (Sessions wrap-up card: a crisis-footer OVERLAY bug + a flat bullet-wall summary;
  user-reported with a screenshot; mockup approved first; spec 09 §3.1; on `feat/sessions-wrapup-redesign`).**
  **(1) The overlay bug (diagnosed from the layout, not assumed):** `WrapUpCard` rendered as a sibling AFTER the
  scrollable `.thread` inside `.main` (grid row 1). A tall summary overflowed the 1fr row and painted OVER the
  pinned crisis footer (`.crisisWrap`, grid row 2) — the "Get help now" + not-medical line floated mid-card. Fix:
  render the card **inside** the `.thread` scroll container (a `.wrapCardSlot`), so it scrolls with the
  conversation + is clipped by `overflow-y:auto` and can never overflow onto the footer; a `scrollIntoView` on
  appear brings its heading to the top. **(2) The redesign:** the card showed `insight.facts` as ONE flat
  `<ul>` (Themes/Goals/Follow-ups/People all mixed with their `Theme:`/`Goal:`/… prefixes) — an unscannable
  wall (the user's session had 10 themes, 4 goals, 6 follow-ups, 4 people). Now a pure `groupWrapUpFacts` routes
  each fact to a section by its code prefix (display-only; stored facts untouched; an unknown prefix → an "Also
  noted" group so nothing drops), rendered as **grouped sections**: Goals & commitments (a checklist, first),
  Themes (chips), Follow-ups (collapsible), People (chips). **Decisions asked + approved (2 forks):** condense
  long lists (themes past 6 → "+N more"; follow-ups collapsed by default); Goals-first order. Gate green:
  typecheck (all), lint, format, **961 core + 920 desktop + 11 relay** unit (+`groupWrapUpFacts` [prefix routing/
  strip/substring-safety/other-fallback], +WrapUpCard RTL [grouped sections, +N-more reveal, collapse toggle,
  Also-noted, section-omitted-when-empty, crisis-leads]; updated the 2 prefixed-text assertions to the stripped
  display text + the group header), **E2E** (the complete+summarize test asserts the grouped "Goals & commitments"
  header + a **geometric overlay guard**: `thread.bottom ≤ crisisFooter.top`, via a new `data-testid=session-thread`).
  **Visual QA:** real Electron screenshot of the rendered card — grouped, scannable, card scrolls inside its own
  region with the crisis footer pinned below (bug gone). Synced spec 09 §3.1. **Lesson: a grid child with no
  `overflow` clip will paint over a sibling row when its content exceeds its 1fr cell — a tall transient card
  belongs INSIDE the scroll container, not as a sibling after it; and grouping a flat fact list is a
  display-only transform keyed off the code-stamped prefixes (`Goal:`/`Theme:`/…), with an `other` catch-all so
  a prefix change never silently swallows a fact.**
- 2026-07-08 — **Build (Sessions: clear the composer on send + a "Wrap up & reflect" button below it; mockup
  approved first; spec 05 §3 + 09 §14.2; on `feat/sessions-clear-field-and-wrap-up`).** Two user asks, mockup
  shown + approved before building (the `visualize` tool — send before/after + the end-button demo). **(1) Bug —
  composer cleared too late.** `Composer.submit()` only cleared the textarea AFTER `onSend` resolved, but `onSend`
  awaits the WHOLE chat turn → the sent text sat in the disabled field the entire time the coach was "thinking,"
  duplicated with the bubble above (user: "confusing"). Fix: **snapshot then clear immediately** on send (the
  message lives in the thread); restore the text + pending attachments only if the send can't even start (a total
  attachment-store failure → `false`). **(2) Feature — a first-class "end + analyze" control.** "Complete &
  summarize" only lived in the per-session ⋯ menu + the proactive AI wrap-up chip, so there was no obvious "I'm
  done, analyze this" affordance. Added a **"Wrap up & reflect"** button centered below the composer running the
  SAME `completeAndSummarize` (setStatus('complete') → summarize) — a relocation, not a second action. **Decisions
  asked (2 forks, user-chosen):** label = "Wrap up & reflect"; AI/memory-off = **hide it** (matches the existing
  summarize gating). Gated `summarizeReady && activeId && messages.length>0 && status!=='complete' && !showSuggestion`
  (never two wrap-up controls at once). Gate green: typecheck (all), lint, format, **961 core + 910 desktop + 11
  relay** unit (+Composer: clears the instant you Send [pending-promise onSend] + restores text on `false`; +Sessions
  RTL: button ends+summarizes on demand + disappears once complete + hidden when memory off), **E2E +1** (send →
  field `toHaveValue('')` → "Wrap up & reflect" → Session summary + Insight written + button gone; the base send E2E
  asserts the clear too). Synced spec 05 §3 + 09 §14.2. **Lesson: a composer that clears only after the send promise
  resolves leaves the message stuck in a disabled field for the whole turn — clear optimistically on send + restore
  on a can't-start failure; and when adding an "end/analyze" affordance, RELOCATE the existing action (the ⋯-menu
  complete-&-summarize) to where users look, don't add a redundant second control (gate it so it never co-exists
  with the proactive wrap-up suggestion).**
- 2026-07-08 — **Fix (Sessions retry made ZERO difference for a session created BEFORE the fix — the LEGACY
  blank-reply ghost; user-reported (furious) with a screenshot; spec 05 §4.1 amended; on
  `fix/sessions-legacy-blank-reply-retry`).** The v0.14.3 retry only appeared when the transcript's last message
  was the **user's**. But the **pre-fail-safe code persisted an empty `{role:'assistant', content:''}` bubble**
  when a reply came back empty (verified against `v0.14.1` — the old `messages.push({role:'assistant', content:
stripCoachMarkers(result.text)})` had NO empty guard). So every session that dead-ended BEFORE the fix ends on
  that **ghost** (`last.role === 'assistant'`), not on the user's message → the retry never fired, and the ghost
  rendered as a blank coach bubble. That's why the user saw no change. **Diagnosed against the code + git history
  (not assumed)** — confirmed the exact legacy persisted state, then **reproduced it FIRST** (an E2E seeding a
  conversation ending in `[user, assistant('')]`) before fixing. **Fix: (1)** `retryReply` now **strips any
  trailing blank assistant message(s)** before the `last.role === 'user'` check, then regenerates (the cleanup
  persists on the success save; legitimate replies always have content, so only ghosts are removed). **(2)** new
  pure renderer helpers `isBlankReply()` + **`awaitingReply(messages)`** (the last REAL message is the user's,
  ignoring trailing blank ghosts) — the store `retry()` guard + the Sessions "Try again" banner now key off
  `awaitingReply`, and the render **skips blank assistant bubbles** (no more ghost bubble). **(3)** defensive:
  `send()`/`retry()` wrap the IPC in try/catch so a THROWN turn always resolves to an honest error (never leaves
  "thinking" stuck forever — the other half of "we need fail-safe measures"). Gate green: typecheck (all), lint,
  format, **961 core + 906 desktop + 11 relay** unit (+core: retryReply recovers a `[user, assistant('')]` legacy
  session → clean `[user, assistant]`; +RTL: a legacy blank-reply session renders no ghost + offers a working Try

  open → ghost absent + Try again → reply → decrypt asserts clean `[user, assistant]`, non-empty). All 13
  Sessions/guided E2E green. Synced spec 05 §4.1. **Lesson: "handle the failure" must include the DATA the OLD
  buggy code already wrote — a fix that only guards the new happy path leaves every pre-fix record stuck; check
  what state the previous version persisted (here, a blank assistant bubble via git), reproduce THAT exact record,
  and make recovery key off the transcript's last REAL message (ignoring ghosts), not a raw `last.role`.**
- 2026-07-08 — **Fix (Sessions retry STILL a dead-end on a RE-OPENED unanswered session — the v0.14.2 fix was
  incomplete; user-reported with a screenshot "im still unable to resend or retry"; spec 05 §4.1 amended; on
  `fix/sessions-reopen-retry`).** The v0.14.2 fix only showed "Try again" while a live `error` was set (cleared
  on `open()`), and it retried by **re-sending the user's text via `chatStream`** — which would DUPLICATE the
  persisted user message. The user's real case: a turn that never got a reply, then the session re-opened —
  transcript ends on their message, no error state → **no retry affordance at all** (a silent dead-end the
  screenshot showed). **Reproduced FIRST** (an E2E that seeds a conversation ending on a user message, re-opens
  it, and asserts the dead-end) before the fix. **Three-part fix: (1)** `chatService` now **persists the user's
  message BEFORE generating the reply** (05 §4.1) — a failed/interrupted turn never loses it; the transcript
  simply ends on the user's message. **(2)** extracted a shared `generateCoachReply()` (system prompt → stream →
  meter-first → empty-check → append+save → guided-step/challenge) used by both `runChatTurn` and a new
  **`retryReply()`** — which re-generates a reply for a conversation whose LAST message is an unanswered user
  message (**never adds a new user message → can't duplicate**), budget-gated + metered, reopens a completed
  session like a continuation. New `chat:retry` IPC through the full seam (channels → coreBridge → ipc [chatSender
  binding] → preload → test-utils). **(3)** the store `retry()` calls `chatRetry` (not re-sending text); the UI
  shows "Try again" whenever **`!sending && the last message is the user's`** — covering both a live failure (with
  its `error`) AND a re-opened unanswered session (a gentle "hasn't been answered yet" prompt). The optional
  in-session nudges (depth-ask 29, goal-raise 40) are intentionally omitted on a recovery turn. Gate green:
  typecheck (all), lint, format, **960 core + 905 desktop + 11 relay** unit (chatService: the empty test now

  All 12 Sessions E2E green. Synced spec 05 §4.1. **Lesson: a "retry" that re-SENDS the user's input duplicates
  it — persist the user's message on send and make retry a REPLY-ONLY op (`retryReply` on the existing

- 2026-07-08 — **Fix (Sessions "thinking then nothing" — a silent empty-reply dead end; fail-safe error + retry;
  SPEC 05 §4.1; user-reported w/ screenshot; on `fix/sessions-empty-reply-failsafe`, PR pending).** A user sent
  a long message, saw "Coach is thinking…", then it stopped with NO response and NO error. **Diagnosed as a
  VERIFIED code bug (not assumed — a transport error WOULD have shown the banner):** chat turns ran with
  `maxTokens: 1024` (too small for a coaching reply) AND adaptive thinking (chat keeps it on, by design) which
  **shares** that budget → the model returned empty/truncated text (`stop_reason: max_tokens`), and the empty
  reply was **swallowed at every layer** (`anthropicClient` → `{text:''}`; `runChatTurn` persisted a blank
  assistant message + returned `ok:true`; the store cleared "thinking" with no error). The recurring
  [[adaptive-thinking-shares-maxtokens]] trap, this time in the CHAT turn. **Fix (fail-safe, the user's ask —
  "retry, resend, show error messages"):** (1) raised the chat ceiling to `CHAT_MAX_TOKENS=4096` (a ceiling, not
  a target — no normal-turn cost bump — so replies aren't starved/truncated); (2) a blank/whitespace reply is now
  an honest `{ok:false, reason:'EMPTY'}` (new `ChatTurnResult` reason) that is **never persisted** as a blank
  turn, with the billed call **metered first** (meter-before-bail); (3) the store's `error` surfaces on every
  failure + a **"Try again"** button (Sessions error Banner) re-runs the last turn (re-sending the last user
  message + its already-stored attachments, no second bubble, only when the last message is the user's — the
  typed message is preserved since a failed turn saves nothing). Extracted `successPatch` (shared by send +
  retry) + `buildChatUsage`. **Also fixed a pre-existing FLAKY E2E** (`intimacy guided sessions: Yes/No/Maybe
builder advances steps`) — its reply assertion lacked `.first()`, so during the stream→persist handoff it
  matched BOTH the streaming bubble + the saved message (a strict-mode violation) → the "load flake" flagged in
  earlier sessions was actually a missing-`.first()` bug; +`.first()` → 4/4 green. Gate green: typecheck (all),
  lint, format, **958 core + 904 desktop** unit (+empty→EMPTY/not-persisted/still-metered/budget-raised, +Sessions

  `SELFOS_FAKE_CHAT_EMPTY` hook gated `!haiku` so the topic-classifier stream — which precedes the chat turn —
  doesn't consume the one-shot: empty → error + Try again → success). Code-reviewer: pending. Synced spec 05 §3.3
  (→ §4.1 fail-safe turn handling). **Lessons: (1) any bounded model `stream` (chat too) needs an empty-reply
  guard that returns an honest failure + never persists a blank turn — silence is the worst failure; a small
  max_tokens ceiling + adaptive thinking sharing it starves the reply. (2) A streaming-reply E2E assertion MUST
  use `.first()` (the stream bubble + saved message both match mid-handoff). (3) The topic classifier streams
  BEFORE the chat turn on haiku and lands in the fake's default branch — a "first stream" test hook must exclude
  it.**

  SENT you showed in your edit list; user-reported "that doesnt make any sense"; on

  `listQuestionnaires` (ALL defs in the shared `questionnaires/defs/` dir) gated only on the
  `questionnaires.create` capability — never by author — so every person saw every household questionnaire,
  including ones others authored + **sent to them** (which belong in the **Inbox**, not the edit list). Fix (one
  scoping filter at the bridge, the trust boundary): the list now returns only defs the active person authored
  (`creatorPersonId === activePersonId`), plus a **legacy creator-less def** (pre-38, no author recorded) stays
  visible to the **Owner** so it isn't orphaned (matches §3.9's "legacy → Owner-deletable-only"). Core
  `listQuestionnaires` stays a low-level list-all (its only caller is the bridge). No schema/IPC change. Gate

  read over a SHARED store (`questionnaires/defs/` is household-wide, not per-person) must scope by the owning
  field (`creatorPersonId`) at the bridge, or every person sees everyone's — the `questionnaires.create`
  capability gates WHO can author, not WHICH defs are theirs; and legacy rows lacking the owning field need a
  fallback owner (the Owner) so scoping doesn't orphan them.**

  `feat/answer-review-edit`, PR pending).** User: after someone answers a questionnaire there's no way to review
  their answers/questions, no way to edit + resend, and the sender isn't told answers changed so their analysis
  goes stale. **Scope asked first (one genuine fork): household (Inbox) ONLY** — external relay recipients
  (purge-on-drain mailbox) + compatibility sends (dual-answer alignment) are explicitly deferred; the edit

  reopen is lazy). **Sender (Results):** each resubmit bumps **`ResponseSet.revision`** (additive-optional,
  `(existing ?? 0) + 1`; `saveProgress` carries it forward during an edit); `analyzeAssignment` stamps
  **`Insight.provenance.analyzedRevision`**; a pure **`isAnalysisStale`** (insight exists AND `revision >
analyzedRevision`, pre-56 defaults to 1 so an un-edited send is never falsely stale) drives an **"Answers
  updated — re-analyze"** chip + a new **`answers-updated`** notification (sender-scoped, `onIncrease` by
  revision). Re-analyzing overwrites the same Insight (idempotent) + catches `analyzedRevision` up → chip +
  nudge clear; `autoAnalyze` re-runs for stale sends (guard keyed `${assignmentId}:${revision}`). **Trust
  boundary:** `assignments:reopen` is recipient-scoped + rejects compatibility (NOT relay — an Inbox item is
  always the household-person recipient, and its relay mailbox was already revoked at first submit);
  `notifications:answersUpdated` is `viewResults`-gated + **carries no raw answers**, so a Private send's boundary
  holds. **No new AI spend** (re-analyze = the existing metered `questionnaire.analyze`); additive schema only
  (no `schemaVersion` bump), one new notification kind. Code-reviewer: pending. Gate green: typecheck (all),
  lint, format, **956 core + 901 desktop** unit (+reopen/revision/reopenable, +analyzedRevision/isAnalysisStale,
  +bridge reopen recipient-scoping + full stale-loop with a decrypt + no-raw-answers-for-Private, +Inbox

  check-in: answer → analyze → review → Edit → Update → Results stale chip → decrypt `revision===2` → Re-analyze
  clears it + decrypt `analyzedRevision===2`; 360px review guard). Synced specs 56 (Approved→Built) + 08 §3.3
  (amended). **Lesson: the `answers-updated` bell is a one-shot per-person read (no mid-session polling), so it
  surfaces on NEXT LAUNCH, not instantly after an in-session edit — the E2E asserts the Results stale chip
  (which DOES refresh on navigation) + a decrypt, and leaves the bell to the bridge + RTL tests; and the reopen
  guard must reject compatibility but NOT relay-linked in-app sends (the mailbox is already dead post-submit),
  or the common household-send-with-a-link case can't be edited.**
- 2026-07-07 — **Build (Onboarding attention indicator — SPEC 55 BUILT; closes #109; on `feat/onboarding-attention`,
  PR pending) + Fix (#95 hide taken tests, PR [#110]).** Two GitHub issues from the member (amarshall1011).
  **#95** (small You-hub fix, `fix/hide-taken-tests`): a test the person has taken now drops out of "Available
  tests" (it already lives at the top under "Your profiles" with Retake / Check in again); a group with no untaken
  tests, and the whole section once everything's taken, self-hides; the 18+ intimacy gate still shows for untaken
  intimacy tests. **#109** (spec 55): a gentle, dismissible **attention indicator** — a `onboarding-updated`
  **notification (bell + toast)**, the Home **`OnboardingCard`** attention branch, and the **Onboarding nav dot** —
  when a person's **completed** onboarding has genuinely-new content or an unfinished section. **All decisions asked
  first (2 rounds):** what counts + where (all three surfaces); then, on surfacing a material consequence, the
  aggressiveness. **The key restraint:** the deep `invited` intake catalog is left `notStarted` by design after
  completion (only `core` is required), so "count every unanswered question" would keep the card + dot lit for
  **every** user forever (always-on). So the rule (pure `onboardingAttention` helper in `routes/onboarding/progress.ts`,
  reusing `visibleQuestions`/`isAnswered`) flags a visible unanswered question only when it is **NEW** (its
  `sectionId.questionId` ∉ a per-person **completion snapshot**) **OR** its section is **`inProgress`** (started, not
  finished) — a `complete` section's remaining optional blanks are deliberate skips and are never nagged about; a
  new chat section un-started counts 1; `adult` sections excluded until the 18+ ack; fires only when
  `session.status === 'complete'`. The snapshot is additive-optional `IntakeSession.knownSectionIds` /
  `knownQuestionKeys` (no `schemaVersion` bump, `.catch(undefined)`), written at portrait synthesis via
  `intakeCatalogSnapshot()` and **baselined for pre-55 complete sessions in `ensureIntakeSession`** (write-once, so
  existing users aren't retroactively nagged and future app updates ARE detectable). **No AI, no spend, no new IPC
  channel, no new vault file** — one additive `'onboarding-updated'` core enum literal; the bell uses `onIncrease`
  (dismiss stays quiet until MORE appears). Gate green: typecheck (all), lint, format, **951 core + 893 desktop**
  unit (+onboardingAttention rule matrix, +snapshot write/baseline core, +OnboardingCard attention branch RTL,
  +useNotificationSources candidate RTL, +the #95 You-hub RTL), **E2E** (#109: a completed session whose snapshot
  omits a real section → card + nav dot + bell → dismiss persists across relaunch + 360px guard; #95: the ECR-R
  flow now asserts the taken test is absent from Available). Synced specs 55 (Approved→Built), 18 §15 (amended), 50
  §3.1. **Lesson: a "flag unanswered onboarding questions" feature is naggy-by-default because intake questions are
  ALL optional and the deep catalog is `notStarted` by design — so "unanswered" ≈ "everyone, forever." The
  non-naggy signal is a per-person COMPLETION SNAPSHOT (detect genuinely-new content) + the `inProgress` status
  (a section left unfinished), never "any blank"; surface that always-on consequence to the user before building.**
- 2026-07-01 — **Fix (dream "Analyze this dream" → "The analysis was cut off before it finished"; the recurring
  adaptive-thinking budget bug, this time in the DREAM + SESSION syntheses; on `fix/dream-analysis-truncation`,
  after the §15 reflection redesign shipped in v0.12.0).** User hit the TRUNCATED message on the live app.
  **Diagnosed from the code (NOT assumed — the message is the honest TRUNCATED parse-outcome, not a refusal):**
  `anthropicClient` enables adaptive `thinking` unless a caller passes `extendedThinking: false`, and adaptive
  thinking **shares the `maxTokens` budget** with the visible output. `dreamAnalysisService.synthesizeAnalysis`
  streamed with `maxTokens: 1500` and **no `extendedThinking: false`**, so thinking starved the 5-section JSON →
  truncated/unclosed → `classifyParseOutcome` → the "cut off" error. **Latent since the original dream synthesis
  (2026-06-11)** — surfaced now the §15 redesign makes analysis easy to reach. The offline fake Claude **hid it**
  (always returns valid JSON), so every E2E stayed green (the [[adaptive-thinking-shares-maxtokens]] +
  fakes-hide-model-bugs traps, both documented). A blast-radius audit of every core `client.stream` found the
  **same defect** in the JSON-producing `sessionAnalysisService` (`maxTokens: 1500`, no flag — would be hit next
  on "End & summarize") and the `dreamPatternService` narrative (bounded prose starved to empty). Fix (the intake
  portrait / generation reference pattern): **disable adaptive thinking** on all three bounded syntheses — dream
  synthesis (`extendedThinking:false` + `maxTokens` 1500→4000), session wrap-up (`false` + 2500), pattern
  narrative (`false`, 800). Unit guards **capture the stream options** and assert `extendedThinking===false` + a
  generous budget for the dream + session syntheses, so the fake can't hide a regression again. Gate green:
  typecheck (node + web/DOM), lint, format, **949 core** unit (+2). No renderer change. **Lesson (again): a
  bounded structured-JSON `client.stream` MUST pass `extendedThinking:false` or adaptive thinking starves the
  output to a truncation — audit EVERY JSON-producing stream call for the flag, not just the reported one, since
  the offline fakes make the whole suite green while the live app truncates.**
- 2026-06-26 — **Fix #3 (onboarding sharing STILL didn't save — `answerSharing` was written for ANSWERED questions
  only; SPEC 43 re-amended again; on `fix/intimacy-sharing-instant-save`).** Third report, with a screenshot: on a
  fresh **intimacy** section the user clicks "share with Partner" on the whole section and it doesn't save. **My
  prior two fixes never tested the intimacy section OR the share-before-answer case** — both my E2Es used `basics`
  with an answer present. **Reproduced FIRST (decrypt E2E driving the exact screenshot):** fresh intimacy section,
  ack 18+, open section sharing → Partner, NO answer → `answerSharing` came back **empty** on the current build →
  proving the bug before any change. **Root cause:** `submitSectionForm`'s `nextSharing` loop iterated
  `Object.keys(section.answers)` — ANSWERED questions only — so a section with nothing answered persisted no scope.
  **Fix (core):** iterate the **union** of answered questions **and** the questions the renderer explicitly scoped
  (`Object.keys(sharing)`), so a fresh-section bulk-share persists for every question (safe: an unanswered question
  has no derived fact, so the scope shares nothing until it IS answered, at which point the pre-set choice is
  honored instead of reverting to the category default). **Fix (panel, "right away"):** a sharing change now saves
  **immediately** (`saveScopesNow` → `autoSaveForm` on the click, `complete:false`), not on the ~600ms debounce —
  only answer TYPING stays debounced (the effect deps dropped `scopes`). Extracted a module-level `cleanAnswers`
  shared by both. Gate green: typecheck (all), lint, **940 core + 855 desktop** unit (+core: persists a scope for
  an UNANSWERED question without inventing an answer; the existing draft test), **E2E +1** (the screenshot repro:
  fresh intimacy section → share Partner with nothing answered → every question's scope persists to the vault; the
  prior first-time + edit-a-completed E2Es still green). **Lessons: (1) test the EXACT surface the user is on — all
  three of my fixes used `basics`; the bug lived on the 18+-gated INTIMACY section + the share-BEFORE-answer path I
  never drove. (2) `answerSharing` keyed off answers means sharing can't precede answering — key it off what the
  user explicitly SCOPED (the renderer sends a scope per question), so "share this whole section" sticks on the
  click. (3) "save right away" means on the CLICK — a debounce that's correct for typing is wrong for a discrete
  sharing tap.**

- 2026-06-26 — **Fix #2 (onboarding STILL didn't save — auto-save was scoped to COMPLETED sections only; SPEC 43
  re-amended; on `fix/onboarding-autosave-all-sections`).** The v0.11.1 fix shipped but the user came back
  (rightly angry): "YOURE OBVIOUSLY NOT PROPERLY TESTING — onboarding questions arent being saved when selected
  and when changing the private status its not saving automatically." **My failure:** I "verified" with an E2E I
  wrote to pass (it tested a COMPLETED section) instead of reproducing the user's REAL scenario (first-time
  onboarding). **This time I reproduced against the running app FIRST:** wrote a decrypt-level E2E driving a
  first-time section → it FAILED on v0.11.1 (`occupation` stayed `null` after filling + changing sharing, no
  Continue) — proving the bug, before touching the fix. **Root cause:** the auto-save effect was gated
  `if (!complete || locked) return` — so it only fired on already-COMPLETED sections; while filling out
  onboarding (every section `notStarted`/`inProgress`), nothing auto-saved. **Fix:** auto-save now fires for
  **every** section, persisting a **DRAFT** — `submitSectionForm` gained a `markComplete` param (default `true`);
  `autoSaveForm` passes **`complete: false`** so a draft persists answers + `answerSharing` but only nudges
  `notStarted`→`inProgress`, NEVER completing the section (only the explicit Continue/Done does, so no premature
  portrait). Added a **flush-on-unmount** (a `flushRef` → latest closure) so a quick Back/section-switch inside the
  ~600ms debounce doesn't drop the last edit, and **cancel-on-explicit-submit** (`cancelAutoSave()` in the
  Continue/Done/Skip handlers) so a debounced draft can't race in AFTER the completing submit and revert it.
  Gate green: typecheck (all), lint, **939 core + 855 desktop** unit (the stale "first-time does NOT auto-save"
  RTL INVERTED to assert it DOES, as `complete:false`; +a core `submitSectionForm` draft test:
  persists-without-completing then an explicit submit completes), **E2E** (the new first-time decrypt test — fill
  - change sharing with NO Continue → both the answer AND the scope persist to the vault, section not complete;
    the existing edit-a-completed-section test still green). **Lessons: (1) NEVER claim verified from a test you
    wrote to pass — reproduce the user's ACTUAL path (first-time vs editing) against the running app, watch it FAIL,
    then fix. (2) An auto-save gated on a state the user isn't in yet (`complete`) is no auto-save — onboarding is
    spent in not-complete sections, so that's exactly where save-on-select had to work. (3) A draft save (a
    `markComplete:false` flag) is how you persist-as-you-go without the side effects of "submit" (completion +
    portrait).**

- 2026-06-26 — **Fix (onboarding sharing didn't save — one-tap + auto-save; SPEC 43 amended; on
  `fix/onboarding-share-autosave`, PR pending).** User: "in intimacy & sexuality I click _share with partner all_
  and Save, and it doesn't save — and let's save right away when clicked, same with all answers." **Diagnosed
  (not assumed):** traced the code — intake sharing was written ONLY by the "Save changes" button
  (`submitForm`→`submitSectionForm`). On a sensitive section the bulk "share all" didn't apply on the pick: it
  popped an inline **confirm** (§8) that REPLACED the picker, so a person who clicked Save without first clicking
  "Share it" silently lost the choice (Save persisted the old Private scopes). The single-scope `intake:setAnswerSharing`
  channel existed but the form never called it. **Owner decisions (asked first, both forks):** **one tap, no confirm**
  - **auto-save sharing AND answers**. Fix: **(1)** removed the §3.1/§8 sensitive-share confirm — `applyScope`/`applyBulk`
    apply directly on one tap (safety preserved by the **default**: a sensitive answer still STARTS Private, so sharing
    is still an explicit choice; the confirm machinery — `pendingShare`/`renderConfirm`/`SECTION_BULK` — is gone). **(2)**
    new silent `intakeStore.autoSaveForm` (re-runs `intake:submitForm` WITHOUT the `busy` toggle, so controls don't
    flicker) + a debounced (600ms) auto-save effect in `IntakeFormPanel` that fires on any answer or scope change **for a
    COMPLETED section** (i.e. being edited); the primary button becomes **"Done"** (a flush + advance). A **first-time
    section is unchanged** — it still uses the explicit **Continue** (which marks it complete; auto-save never completes
    a section being filled the first time, so no premature portrait). Gate green: typecheck (all), lint, **855 desktop**
    unit (3 reworked IntakeFormPanel RTL: per-question one-tap+auto-save, bulk share-all auto-save [the reported bug],
    first-time-does-NOT-auto-save; removed the two confirm tests), **E2E** (the existing per-question-sharing decrypt
    test extended: re-open the now-complete basics section → widen to +Sibling → it persists to the vault with NO Save
    click). Visual QA (real Electron screenshot): the section reads clean — honest explainer, one-tap sharing chips, no
    confirm clutter. Synced spec 43 (amendment). **Lesson: a confirm that REPLACES the control it guards is a silent
    data-loss trap — a user reads the picker as "done" and the pending choice evaporates on the next click; and
    per-question intake sharing must be writable on its own (`setAnswerSharing`) OR auto-saved, never gated solely behind
    a section-level Save the user may not reach. ALSO (repeated my own footgun): `git checkout <file>` reverts UNCOMMITTED
    work — and I started this fix on `main` without branching; commit/branch BEFORE injecting throwaway screenshots.**

- 2026-06-26 — **Build (owner AI intimacy-topic suggester — SPEC 08 §16.5a AI-assist; on `feat/ai-intimacy-topics`,
  PR pending).** The last item of the 2026-06-26 batch. The owner-only Intimacy Topics settings control gains a
  **"Suggest with AI"** affordance. **All 3 product/UX forks asked first (user-chosen):** lives **in the existing
  owner control** (not a separate panel); driven by a **subject box that falls back to a general varied batch when
  blank** ("Both"); suggestions are added via a **pick-and-edit checklist** ("tick + edit, then Add selected"). Core
  `@selfos/core/intimacy/suggestService.ts` (`suggestIntimacyTopics`) — one metered **`intimacy.suggestTopics`** pass
  (budget-gated, meter-BEFORE-parse, tolerant `extractJsonObject` + honest failures, `extendedThinking:false`) that
  proposes consensual-adult **activity + fantasy** topics and **dedupes** them case-insensitively against the merged
  inventory (built-in + custom; an all-dupes result is an honest EMPTY). **Persists nothing** — the owner reviews +
  the existing `addCustomIntimacyTopic` path commits the chosen ones. The consensual-adult boundary lives in the
  prompt + the model (never a keyword filter); the Owner is the full-access role so the seam is gated `people.manage`
  (owner-only), and **AI-off is a calm state** (no dead button). IPC `questionnaires:suggestIntimacyTopics` through
  the full seam + the offline fake-Claude branch (returns a set incl. an existing built-in, so the dedupe is
  exercised offline). Renderer: the control gains a subject `Textarea` + "Suggest with AI" → a checklist of
  checkbox+editable rows → "Add selected (N)". Additive schema (`IntimacyTopicSuggestResult` + the usage type) — no
  migration. Gate green: typecheck (all), lint, **938 core + 854 desktop** unit (4 core suggester [dedup/meter/ground,
  no-subject, NO_KEY, EMPTY] + 6 control RTL [suggest/pick/edit/add, EMPTY surface, non-owner hidden] + a coreBridge
  test [owner deduped, member denied, AI-off calm]), **E2E** (the Settings flow: Suggest → checklist → a built-in
  deduped out → uncheck one → Add selected → persisted across both kinds). Visual QA (real Electron screenshot): the
  subject box + the pick-and-edit checklist + "Add selected (3)" read clean + cohesive with Settings. Synced spec 08
  §16.5a. **Lesson: a "suggest then add" feature is cheapest as an EPHEMERAL pass (persist nothing) layered on the
  existing add path — the suggester only computes deduped candidates, the owner's checklist drives the existing
  per-topic add, so there's no new persistence, no migration, and the dedupe is the one real guarantee (the prompt's
  avoid-list just nudges the model).**

- 2026-06-26 — **Build (guided-sessions expansion — fuller therapy/coaching + a Family group + catalog search;
  on `feat/guided-sessions-expansion`, PR pending).** Additive content + one small UI feature (an extension of
  spec 16/48, no new machinery, no schema/IPC). **New `family` group "Family & relationships"** (12
  family-dynamics chat sessions — family role, a parent, siblings, boundaries, in-laws, inherited patterns,
  repairing a rift, aging parents, your parenting, co-parenting, estrangement, gathering prep), and the
  **Reflective** + **Coaching** groups grow to a fuller ~12 each (+worry time, thinking traps, three good
  things, name the feeling, urge surfing; +habit builder, getting unstuck, time & priorities, strengths,
  future self). Plumbing: `GuidedGroupId += 'family'`, `GUIDED_GROUPS`, `GUIDE_LIFE_AREAS.family`. Every entry
  leads with the shared `frame()` not-therapy boundary; **family is never adult-gated** (the `adult ===
(group === 'intimacy')` catalog invariant holds — a unit asserts it). With ~56 browsable sessions now, a
  **catalog search** filters across every group by name/framework/topic (non-matching groups collapse away, a
  calm empty state when nothing matches, and the **18+ intimacy group is never surfaced via search before the
  ack** — the no-leak guard). Gate green: typecheck (all), lint, **934 core + 851 desktop** unit (the new
  family group + fuller-set assertions; 4 GuidedCatalog RTL incl. the no-leak guard), **E2E +1** (browse the
  Family group + filter across groups + empty state + clear). Visual QA (real Electron screenshots): the
  search sits cleanly above the catalog; filtering to "boundaries" shows only the matching Family cards —
  sleek + intentional. Synced spec 16 §3.1/§3.2. **Lesson: `git checkout <file>` reverts UNCOMMITTED changes
  too — injecting a throwaway screenshot into an uncommitted E2E then `git checkout`-ing to revert the
  screenshot wipes the whole new test; commit the test first, then inject/revert screenshots over the committed
  baseline.**

- 2026-06-26 — **Build (Memory redesign — sharing is context not display + relationship insights + test-sharing
  default; SPEC 54 BUILT; on `feat/memory-redesign`, PR pending).** Two user-reported problems: Memory DISPLAYED a
  partner's raw shared answers, and it was a wall of text. **The concept fix (the core):** a partner's shared data
  feeds the viewer's AI context but is **NEVER shown raw** — the spec-44 "about people you relate to" section is
  GONE. **The redesign:** a summary strip + an **"About you" / "Partners" toggle** (renamed from "Relationships" to
  avoid colliding with the "Relationships" life-area). "About you" = own data (search/filters [subject filter
  dropped], drafts, goals, trends, insights by life-area). "Partners" = a per-partner **`RelationshipInsightsCard`**
  showing a **new AI relationship-insights synthesis** (`relationshipSynthesisService` — reads the viewer's own
  digest + the partner's SHARED facts via `factSharedWithViewer`, emits gentle observations about the viewer + the
  dynamic; explicit-tap "Reflect on us" / Refresh, cached per `(viewer, partner)`, budget-gated + weekly-capped,
  metered `relationship.synthesize` before parse; the prompt forbids quoting the partner's raw answers), with the
  explicit "used as insight for your coach, never shown as their raw answers" footer. **The test-sharing default
  (bundled):** test results (incl. sensitive intimacy + wellbeing) now default-share with the **`partner`**
  relationship type. **The privacy-critical fork, resolved the SAFE way:** sensitive (kink/sexuality) facts are no
  longer `restricted` (so they can reach a partner) — `restricted` stays reserved for break-glass **intake**
  trauma/intimacy facts (UNCHANGED, reach no one) — and the own-context relevance gate now keys off the sensitive
  **life-area** (`SENSITIVE_CONTEXT_LIFE_AREAS = {'Intimacy'}`) in both `summarizeForContext` and `digestableInsights`,
  so kink still surfaces only in intimacy contexts and never the topic-free digests. Proven: every existing
  intake/cross-person privacy test still passes + new tests (a sensitive test reaches a PARTNER never a sibling; the
  synthesis digest sees only shared facts). Schemas additive (`RelationshipSynthesis`, `relationship.synthesize`
  usage type); IPC `relationships:synthesize`/`:getSynthesis` gated `memory.own` + partner-only. Gate green:
  typecheck (all), lint, **932 core + 847 desktop** unit (+relationship synthesis [5], +Memory RTL "never displays
  related raw" + Partners-view card/generate, +the updated kink-partner-shareable bridge test), **E2E +1** (decrypt-
  level: a partner's shared/private facts never show raw, the Partners view shows AI insights, the synthesis caches,
  360px clean). Visual QA (real Electron screenshots, desktop): the summary strip + toggle read sleek/scannable; the
  Partners card shows insight-bullets + the "never their raw answers" footer. **Lesson: keep `restricted` as the
  pure break-glass "never broadcast-shared" flag (intake trauma/intimacy) and drive own-context relevance-gating off
  a SENSITIVE life-area set instead — that lets a sensitive test result be partner-shareable AND still intimacy-only
  in the viewer's own context, without touching the gate that keeps intake facts private (every existing privacy
  test stayed green, the empirical proof the gate change was safe).**

- 2026-06-26 — **Build (Home encouragement engine — SPEC 53 SLICE B BUILT; on `feat/home-encouragement-slice-b`,
  PR pending).** The Slice-A engine (the deterministic "For you" recommendation ranker) grows to cover the
  2026-06 feature batch by adding **3 providers as engine built-ins** (`BUILT_IN_RECOMMENDATION_PROVIDERS`), with
  **no `Home.tsx` card-wiring** — the §5.5 payoff: **`take-a-test`** (50, gate `tests.own`) invites a first
  personality/relationships self-assessment when none is taken; **`wellbeing-checkin`** (51, gate `tests.own`, NOT
  18+) gently invites a mood/anxiety re-check only when a prior PHQ-9/GAD-7 check-in has gone **≥14 days quiet** (a
  soft invitation on the §51 §3.4 window — **never** for someone who never checked in, **never** escalating, §8) with
  a signal-aware `wellbeing-checkin:<lastAt>` dismissKey; **`intimacy-exercise`** (48, gate `sessions.own` +
  `adultGate: true`) invites a guided intimacy exercise **only** once the per-person 18+ ack exists AND an
  intimacy-group test was taken (so it reads "for them", never a premature/unsolicited sexual push — triple-gated:
  the engine's adultGate filter, the engagement signal, AND the adult-test catalog withholding). The shared
  mood/anxiety re-check window (`RECHECK_AFTER_DAYS`/`RECHECKABLE_INSTRUMENTS`/`daysSince` + a new `wellbeingCheckin`
  aggregate) was extracted into `home/wellbeing.ts` and **You.tsx refactored onto it (DRY)**. Home now loads the
  `testStore` in its per-person effect (**consolidating** the previously-separate PHQ-9 fetch — the WellbeingCard
  sibling series now reads `resultsByTest['phq9']`) and assembles `testResults` (instrument + **group** + when),
  `wellbeingCheckinDue`, `lastWellbeingCheckinAt` into `PersonRecommendationState`; refined the Slice-B state
  placeholders (added `group` to `testResults`; removed the unused `intimacyExerciseAvailable`; added
  `lastWellbeingCheckinAt`). **Also fixed a latent spec-52 wiring bug:** Home's reactive capability snapshot omitted
  `challenges.own` (and `tests.own`), so the challenge providers were filtered out and **never surfaced** — both added
  to the set. No new IPC, no new vault schema, no new AI spend (§6 holds). Code-reviewer **ship** (no blockers; the
  18+ triple-gate, wellbeing never-escalating/never-on-never-checked-in, per-person isolation, the testStore
  consolidation not breaking the sibling series, and the DRY refactor all verified; 2 optional tuning nits). Gate
  green: typecheck (all packages), lint, format, **918 core + 844 desktop** unit (the 3 providers'
  relevance/gating/scoring/dismiss-signal + the `wellbeingCheckin` due/calm/never-checked-in cases + Home RTL for each
  new card incl. the 18+ gate hiding the intimacy card even when the profile exists), **E2E +2** (self-assessment +
  wellbeing recs surface + take-a-test routes to You; intimacy exercise only after the 18+ ack + 360px clean). Synced
  spec 53 (→ Built Slice A+B, §5.1/§11.1 + changelog). NOTE: the heavy spec-52 challenge two-flow E2E (`co-create a
challenge…`) times out at 30s when run as the ~5th test in a batch — a **pre-existing accumulated-load flake**
  (verified: it fails 5th after four UNRELATED session tests that never touch Home, passes reliably in isolation; my
  changes touch no path it exercises). **Lesson: adding a provider changes WHAT competes for the capped "For you"
  slots, so an existing For-you test that asserts a specific runner-up must seed the new provider's satisfied state to
  stay focused — the ranking is the contract, not a fixed card set; and a renderer capability snapshot that gates the
  engine must list EVERY provider's gate (the spec-52 challenge providers were silently dead because `challenges.own`
  was missing — they passed their unit test, which put the gate in the state set, while the real app filtered them
  out).**

  v1.1 Part A** (focus), **AQ-10 + RAADS-R** (social/sensory). **The safety core (§8):** a pure, AI-free
  `@selfos/core/tests/wellbeingCrisis.ts` (`detectWellbeingCrisis`/`answerTriggersCrisis`/`crisisItemPositive`/
  `resolveWellbeingBand`) flags a positive PHQ-9 item 9 **or** a high `crisis` band → sets `crisisFlag` on **both**
  the `TestResult` and the derived Insight → feeds the §40 `aggregateCrisisSignal` + Home `CrisisSupportBanner`
  unchanged; the renderer escalates a prominent `role="alert"` banner **mid-check-in, before scoring** (client-
  evaluable from the definition); crisis routing is **independent of every setting + works AI-off**. **The
  non-diagnostic reframe (§8.1):** the internal clinical band (`clinicalKey`) is kept on the result for trends/crisis
  ONLY and **never shown** — the person sees a gentle `WellbeingBand.display` range + a low→high bar (no clinical
  axis) + the **always-present professional-help line**; the optional `test.narrate` is extra-bounded **and never
  receives the clinical key** (`scoreDigest` maps it to the gentle display). **Privacy (§8.4):** wellbeing facts are
  `shareable:false` with no `shareableWith`/`shareableTypes`, own-context only. **Additive schema** (`TestDefinition`
  gains `wellbeing`/`crisisItems`/`bands`/`attribution`/`lifeArea`; `TestGroupId += 'wellbeing'`; `TestSummary`
  display fields) — no migration. `deleteResult` now **re-derives** the Insight from the latest remaining take so a
  partial delete never leaves a stale trend/crisis flag. Renderer: the You-hub "Reflections & check-ins" group, the
  framing-first intro + Stop affordance, the gentle-band result, the Home sibling check-in series (read from dated
  PHQ-9 results), a passive ~14-day "check in again" prompt. `Banner` gained an additive `role` prop. Code-reviewer
  **ship-after-one-should-fix** (the narrative clinical-key leak — fixed; + the partial-delete re-derivation +
  dead-compute nit). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **863 core + 823 desktop** unit (the crisis hook +
  per-instrument band vectors + the bridge + the partial-delete re-derive + the narrative gentle-band-only guard +
  RTL for hub/take/result/Home) + **2 E2E** (mood check-in → gentle result + help line + retake trend + Home sibling
  - 360px; PHQ-9 item-9 mid-check-in crisis + decrypt own-only `crisisFlag` + Home aggregation, AI off; spec-50 E2E
    no-regression). Visual QA at desktop + 360px (real web-preview screenshots — the wellbeing group, framing-first
    intro, the mid-check-in crisis banner, the gentle result; no overflow, no console errors). Synced spec 51
    (→ Built, §11 resolved) + spec 17 drift (the WellbeingCard sibling series). **Instrument-items note:**
    PHQ-9/GAD-7/ASRS/AQ-10 embed the actual items with attribution; RAADS-R's 80 items are register-faithful
    adaptations (not verbatim) with the Ritvo citation, scored as a single summative total into gentle bands —
    mirroring the spec-50 precedent. **Lesson: the internal clinical band must be firewalled from EVERY user/model
    surface — the result render gates on `test.wellbeing` (not on the band resolving) so a degenerate result can't
    fall through to clinical bars, and the narrative digest maps the clinicalKey→gentle display before the prompt;
    and a per-instrument derived Insight only keeps the LATEST take, so a Home trend "sibling series" must read the
    dated RESULTS, not the single Insight's metric.**

- 2026-06-26 — **Build (Self-assessments / "Tests" engine + the "You" hub — SPEC 50 BUILT; on
  `feat/self-assessments-tests`, PR pending).** The personalization backbone: deterministically-scored standardized
  instruments that produce a structured profile feeding the coach app-wide. **All 4 material §11 decisions asked
  first:** hub = **"You"** (`/you`); depth = **fuller** (Big Five **IPIP-120** + Attachment **ECR-R 36**); **one
  slice**; the AI narrative **may name specifics**. Recommendation-takes for the rest (auto-feed own-context +
  reviewable in Memory; kink subscales = spec 49's 14 `INTIMACY_CATEGORIES`; non-sensitive results own-only v1;
  conservative crisis flagging — no v1 item flags, mechanism retained). **Core `@selfos/core/tests`:** a pure,
  AI-free **`scoreTest`** (reverse-scoring `-`-prefix → `min+max−value`; `sum`/`mean` aggregate; normalize unit
  0..1 / signed −1..1; descriptor bands; **total — never throws**, clamps/omits bad cells) + four `TestDefinition`s
  (Big Five IPIP-120, ECR-R 36, Kinsey/Klein sexuality, and the **kink inventory GENERATED from spec 49's
  `intimacyActivitiesByCategory()`** — 14 category subscales, a branched per-category opt-in, so the two stay one
  source of truth). **The result→Insight bridge (`testService`):** scores → an encrypted `TestResult` (retake =
  NEW file + `reTakeOf`, trends keep every take) → an Insight (`source:'test'`, `approved:true`, retake **reuses
  `insightId`** [UPDATE not duplicate] + preserves `createdAt`); **sensitive (kink/sexuality) results write
  `restricted` facts tagged `lifeArea:'Intimacy'`**; the **only metered call** is the optional `test.narrate`
  (admin-only `$`, meter-before-return); a context provider registers into 08's registry. **Privacy (the central
  guarantee):** a new relevance gate in `summarizeForContext` (insightStore) feeds a sensitive test insight to the
  taker's OWN intimacy-topic context **only** — never a money chat, never another person's context; **fail-closed**
  when a restricted fact has no life-area, and a `sensitive ⇒ adult` catalog invariant (both code-reviewer
  hardenings). **Seam:** `tests:list/get/take/results/narrate/acknowledgeAdult/deleteResult/deleteAll`, all gated
  `tests.own` + active-person-scoped + the 18+ group withheld in the bridge (not just the UI); `tests.own`

    the optional narrative + calm AI-off/budget states, history, Retake/Delete), a per-person `testStore` (reset on
    `activePerson.id`). **Additive schema** (`InsightSource += 'test'`, provenance `testId`/`testResultId`,
    `TestResult`) — no version bump; the 3 Memory `Record<InsightSource>` maps extended. Code-reviewer **ship** (the
    privacy boundary verified airtight end-to-end; both fail-closed hardenings applied). Gate green: typecheck, lint,

    per-fact lifeArea gating alone leaks the summary into a money chat; and the gate must fail CLOSED when a
    restricted fact carries no life-area. The user-facing "N questions" count must be answerable LEAF items (matrix
    rows), never the matrix-container count.**
- 2026-06-25 — **Build (Intimacy activities inventory — categorized, tiered expansion — SPEC 49 BUILT; on
  `feat/intimacy-activities-inventory`, PR pending).** Restructured the shared `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES` from a flat
  ~30-string list into a **categorized, tiered** inventory `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES_FULL` (~94 entries `{key, label,
category, tier}` across **14 categories**, tiers 1 gentle→5 extreme, sensual→extreme) — the foundational shared
  content the kink test (`50`) consumes as subscales. **All 4 §11 decisions asked first (all recommended
  defaults):** ship the proposed ~94 starter list as-is; **all categories, grouped, open by default** (no
  pick-categories step); **5 tiers**; **fold the two relationship dynamics into `power-exchange`** (slugs preserved
  as stable keys → no-loss carry-forward). Two minor §11 calls took the spec recommendation: keep `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES`
  as the **flat label list** (least churn — generation reads it byte-unchanged) + add `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES_FULL`;
  `INTIMACY_FANTASIES` left flat. **Builds on 46's stable-key `MatrixRow` model:** `activityRows.ts` iterates the
  categorized inventory in display order, matches the two oral rows by stable key, and the extended
  `LEGACY_ACTIVITY_KEY_MAP` carries every pre-49 split/rename (`'Bondage'`→`light-bondage-cuffs-ties`, `'Choking
(giving)'`→`breath-play-choking-giving`, `'BDSM / dom-sub play'`→`switching`, …) forward read-time (`'Squirting'`
  intentionally orphan-preserved — no close entry, no data loss); **no `schemaVersion` bump** (additive). New core
  `grouping.ts` (`groupMatrixRowsByCategory`/`matrixGroupsForRows`/`resolvedActivityMatrix`); additive
  `Question.matrix.groups` (`{label, rowKeys}[]`, intake-only); the `@selfos/answering` matrix renders **category
  headers** (plain `<h4>` headings — every group **open by construction**, never a collapsed `<details>`, so the
  full surface renders to the bottom — CLAUDE.md §7/§12) when `groups` present, **flat byte-identically** otherwise
  (questionnaire matrices pass none → unchanged). Catalog + `activityContext` + `IntakeFormPanel` pass the grouped
  matrix. **Safety (§8):** every entry stays in the 18+/`restricted`/owner-visible intimacy matrix; `taboo-fantasy`
  worded strictly as fantasy/roleplay (a forbidden-substring unit guard); no minors/real-non-consent/illegal as
  entries; boundary in the prompt + model, never a keyword filter. Code-reviewer **ship** (no blockers/should-fixes;
  carry-forward audited entry-by-entry, key-uniqueness verified, the grouped/flat render split + the partition
  invariant confirmed; applied the one nit — a defensive dedupe guard in the grouped render). Gate green: typecheck,
  lint, format (the pre-existing `site/index.html` prettier-unclean left untouched), **817 core + 801 desktop** unit
  (inventory integrity: unique keys/exhaustive category labels/~60–100 band/oral stable keys/taboo wording; grouping
  - ordering; pre-49 carry-forward incl. the `Squirting` orphan; synthesis label mapping; generation-still-reads-flat;
  - IntakeFormPanel grouped-render RTL), **E2E** (the onboarding intimacy flow now asserts grouped headers +
    renders-to-the-bottom + no-overflow at 390 **and** 360px; the anatomy-edit test doubles as the carry-forward proof
    — seeds a pre-49 `bondage` key → migrates to `light-bondage-cuffs-ties` on decrypt; the questionnaire matrix E2E
    stays green as the flat regression). Synced spec 49 (→ Built, §11 resolved) + cross-refs into 27 §5 and 08 §16.5a.
    **Sequencing: 46 (Built) → 49 (Built) → 50.** NOTE: a pre-existing, unrelated E2E failure (`progressive profile:
… depth invitation → Go deeper (29)`) fails identically on clean `main` (verified by stash+rebuild) — not caused
    by this change. **Lesson: when an inventory's display LABEL changes but the persisted KEY must stay stable, a flat
    list → categorized one is safe ONLY if `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES` keeps pointing at the labels (generation is
    label-driven) and `LEGACY_ACTIVITY_KEY_MAP` maps every renamed old label/slug to the closest new stable key; and
    a long grouped matrix's "open by default" is best a plain heading (open by construction), never a `<details>`,
    so the §7 renders-to-the-bottom guard can't regress. A decrypt-the-persisted-value E2E that reads ONCE after an
    async Continue submit is racy under batch load — poll it.**
- 2026-06-25 — **Build (Intimacy & connection guided sessions — SPEC 48 BUILT; on `feat/intimacy-guided-sessions`,
  PR pending).** Greatly expanded the `16` guided-session **Intimacy & connection** group from 3 → **20 entries**
  (17 new: 16 chat + 1 structured `yes-no-maybe-builder`), spanning relational connection → explicit
  consensual-adult sexual wellness (sensual → kink/power-exchange). **All 4 §11 decisions asked first (all
  recommended defaults):** ship all 17 as proposed; explicitness **graded per session** (graphic where the topic
  calls for it — dirty-talk/kink/fantasy/exploring-an-act/edging/sexting/the builder; warm-but-non-explicit for
  `feeling-desirable`/`intimacy-after-change`); the Yes/No/Maybe builder is **conversation-only** (transcript +
  SessionInsight, persistence deferred to spec 50); **every entry stays in the 18+-gated intimacy group**
  (preserving the `adult === (group === 'intimacy')` invariant). **Purely additive content + the one structured
  exercise — NO schema, IPC, capability, or nav change:** a guided session is already an ordinary `05`/`09`
  Conversation carrying `guideId` (`16` §4.2), so streaming/metering/lifecycle/summarize/the 18+ ack all reuse
  unchanged; the builder reuses the existing `[[SELFOS:STEP:n]]` machinery (`kind:'structured'` + `steps`), no new
  step mechanism. **Safety (§8):** every addendum **leads** with the shared `frame()` not-therapy boundary
  (appended AFTER PERSONA + SAFETY by `buildSystemPrompt`); every **explicit** addendum states the consensual-adult
  / within-Anthropic-policy boundary in-prompt (consensual adults only; taboo only as fantasy/roleplay; never
  minors/real non-consent/illegal); the four trauma-intersecting entries (`sexual-shame`, `feeling-desirable`,
  `kink-power-exchange`, `exploring-an-act`) carry the §8.4 watch-for-distress → slow-down → validate →
  route-to-support clause (the code-reviewer's one should-fix: `exploring-an-act` was missing it; added, + a parity
  clause on kink); partnered entries carry a solo-framing fallback so the coach never presumes a partner who isn't
  there (§7). The **fake Claude** gained a builder-step branch gated strictly on the builder's unique addendum
  phrase (`'Yes/No/Maybe model'`, so it can't collide with the existing structured Thought Record E2E), streaming a
  real `[[SELFOS:STEP:1]]` marker so the stepper-advance E2E exercises genuine marker stripping. Code-reviewer
  **fix-first** (safety clause + spec-count reconcile applied; all mechanics — the 18+ invariant, structured
  reuse, fake-Claude isolation, content-correctness — verified). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **796 core +
  800 desktop** unit (catalog integrity + updated structured-set assertion + explicit-boundary + builder-steps;
  `promptBuilder`/`guidanceService` extended for a new intimacy id; SessionLauncher RTL), **E2E +2** (a new
  explicit card runs + summarizes [asserts `provenance.guideId` by decrypt] + 18+ gate + 390px overflow; the
  builder advances the stepper via a marker stripped from visible text). Visual QA at desktop (clean 3-up card
  grid with the 18+ badge + ⚙ Steps marker) + 390px (no overflow). Synced specs 48 (→ Built; §11 resolved; the
  spec's 16/19 arithmetic reconciled to 17/20) + 16 (intimacy-group + structured-set cross-refs). **Lesson: an
  all-in-one E2E that chains TWO full session flows (explicit card + summarize AND the builder + step-advance) +
  an overflow guard blew the 30s per-test budget under load (2/3 failed on `--repeat-each=3`) — split into two
  focused tests (~1.5s each, reliably green); each guided-session E2E should cover ONE lifecycle, not two.**
- 2026-06-25 — **Build (Home dashboard uplift + personalized encouragement engine — SPEC 53 Slice A BUILT; on
  `feat/home-encouragement-engine`, PR pending).** The capstone Home redesign + a deterministic recommendation
  engine. **All 8 §11 product decisions asked first (all recommended defaults):** section named **"For you"**;
  count **scaled 1–3 by proactivity** (off=hidden, gentle ≤2, active ≤3); recommendation phrasing
  **deterministic** (no per-load AI); momentum = **one warm header line** + 3 reflections (showed-up / explored-
  areas / goals-moving), **CONFIRMED no streaks/targets/gaps**; celebration = **transient success toast**; crisis
  suppression = **suppress all pushes while `aggregateCrisisSignal` recurring** (a single low-mood reading does
  not); the §3.6 **two-zone card map confirmed**; **reuse `coaching.proactivity`** (off = status-grid-only).
  **Core `@selfos/core/recommendations`:** a Zod-first **registry** (`registerRecommendationProvider`/`list`/
  `reset`/`registerBuiltIn` — the `contextProviders.ts` pattern) + **8 built-in providers** (continue-session,
  stale-goal, refresh-portrait, depth-invitation, synthesis-observation, guided-suggestion, questionnaire-gap,
  refresh-memory) + the pure **`rankRecommendations`** (filter gated/18+ → gather → crisis/off/new-suppress →
  dismissals → score → variety-dedup → top-N) + pure **`computeMomentum`** (positive counts only — `no streak/gap`
  is a TYPE-LEVEL guarantee) + **`pendingCelebration`** (newest recent uncelebrated, once). **Home restructured**
  into the §3.1 hierarchy: greeting + `MomentumLine` → `CrisisSupportBanner` → **`ForYou`** (the focal zone) →
  `OnboardingCard` (status) → status grid (`ContinueCard`/`WellbeingCard`/`DreamsCard`/`MemoryCard`/`InboxCard`)
  or `GettingStarted` → `WelcomeOrientationCard` (moved to the bottom so For-you leads) → `CelebrationMoment` toast
  → `CrisisFooter`. New components `ForYou`/`RecommendationCard`/`RecommendationItem`/`MomentumLine`/
  `CelebrationMoment`. **DELETED** the 6 absorbed cards — `GoalFollowupCard` + `InsightOfTheWeekCard` (40),
  `DiscoveryNudge` + `SuggestionsCard` (41/17), `ProfileFreshnessCard` + `DepthInvitationCard` (29) — folding
  their actions into `RecommendationItem` **verbatim** (goal Still on it / Mark done / Let it go, synthesis run +
  "Talk it through", guided start/regenerate, questionnaire gap-finder, depth go-deeper); removed `buildStatusLine`.
  **No new IPC, no new vault schema, no new AI spend:** reuses the spec-41 `discovery:*` device-local per-person
  seam for `rec:<dismissKey>` dismissals + `celebrate:<key>` signatures, and the spec-40 `coaching.proactivity`
  dial. Code-reviewer **fix-first** (all applied): the dismissal `dismissKey` is now **signal-aware** (e.g.
  `stale-goal:<goalId>:<lastTouchedAt>`) so a dismissed rec **re-surfaces when its signal changes** instead of
  dying forever (§7) — the reviewer's blocker-adjacent should-fix; removed dead `buildStatusLine`; deduped
  `stalestGoal` into one exported core `stalestOpenGoal` (the notification + the "For you" card can't diverge);
  fixed a stale test comment. Gate green: typecheck (all packages), lint, format, **791 core + 799 desktop** unit
  (engine rank/momentum/celebration/registry + re-surface-on-signal-change; Home/ForYou/RecommendationCard/
  CelebrationMoment RTL), **E2E +2** (the "For you" zone ranks/reflects-momentum/dismisses + 360px guard;
  proactivity-off hides the zone, keeps the grid). Visual QA at desktop (the focal "For you" zone leads above a
  clean status grid; warm, non-nagging). Synced specs 53 (→ Slice A Built, §11 resolved) + as-built amendments to
  17/29/40/41. **Slice B (48–52 providers) deferred** — each registers its own provider with NO `Home.tsx` edit.
  **Lesson: absorbing N hand-wired Home cards into one ranked engine means moving WHERE/HOW each is surfaced,
  never WHAT it does — keep each absorbed action verbatim inside the uniform `RecommendationCard`. A dismissal
  signature must carry the SIGNAL identity (the goal id + touch stamp), not just the provider id, or "Not now"
  silently kills the feature forever; and a `MomentumReflection` type that can only hold positive counts makes
  "no streaks/no overdue" a compile-time guarantee, not a review hope.**
- 2026-06-25 — **Build (onboarding intake quality pass — SPEC 47 BUILT; on `feat/onboarding-quality-pass`, a
  worktree, PR pending).** A holistic audit-and-remediate pass over the personal-onboarding intake (spec 18), after
  several user-reported bugs. **Owner decisions (asked first):** **Conservative** trim (fix wording/collisions/
  branching/layout + the synthesis bug; **cut nothing**), **keep section order**, **non-empty** placeholder guard,
  and scope = **onboarding intake AND the questionnaire builder** (the user overrode the spec's onboarding-only
  recommendation). 46 is already merged, so the sequencing question was moot. **Audit findings:** the catalog is
  clean — no two questions share an identical prompt (167 Qs), no id reused across sections, every branch trigger is
  earlier/same-section/discrete and can actually produce its match value (no stranded follow-ups), intimacy flows
  low→high with safety always before the `getSpecific` gate. **One real engine defect (audit-proven, §5/§7):**
  orphaned answers for branch-**hidden** questions (a trigger cleared after answering its follow-up) fed synthesis/
  analysis as if chosen. The **relay** answering page already filtered visible answers; the **Inbox**
  (`toAnswerList`) and the **intake** (synthesis `formAnswersMessages` + `factScopeForSection`) did not. Fix: one
  shared `visibleAnswers(questions, answers)` in `@selfos/core/questionnaires/answering` — Inbox + relay (refactored
  DRY) filter at submit, intake filters at synthesis (keeps the stored answer so a re-toggle restores it),
  `analyzeAssignment` defensively filters against the snapshot for pre-fix drafts. **Wording fixes (ids preserved):**
  `coachStyle` reframed to TONE ("What coaching tone do you respond to best?") dropping the "Challenge me" option that
  duplicated `supportStyle`; `appearanceDescription` "…how you look?" → "…your appearance?"; `importantDates` "Any
  important dates to remember?" → "Any dates you'd like me to remember?". **No schema/IPC change.** Tests: catalog
  collision + branching truth-table + cleared-trigger + coachStyle-distinct units, a `visibleAnswers` unit, intake +
  questionnaire-analysis drop-orphan units, and the intimacy conditional-reveal E2E extended with the cleared-trigger
  hide; updated the E2E's reworded labels + made 4 intake-synthesis tests realistic (they set the branch trigger the
  new filter requires). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **764 core + 803 desktop + 11 relay** unit; onboarding
  (13) + questionnaire/inbox/relay/compatibility (20) E2E green. Synced spec 47 (→ Built). **Lesson: a "submit/analyze
  the answers" path must filter to currently-VISIBLE questions or a cleared-trigger orphan feeds the model as if
  chosen — the relay had it right and the Inbox/intake didn't; centralize the rule (`visibleAnswers`) so surfaces
  can't drift. And a test that submits a branch-gated answer WITHOUT its trigger is an impossible-in-UI setup — a
  correct visibility filter exposes it, so make the setup realistic rather than weaken the filter.**
- 2026-06-25 — **Build (intimacy activity-matrix accuracy — SPEC 46 BUILT; GitHub issue #62; on
  `feat/intimacy-matrix-accuracy`).** The onboarding intimacy activity matrix showed a sexual-act oral row that
  was **wrong** for some people because the oral labels were **inferred** (own anatomy from `gender`, partner
  anatomy from `drawnTo`/orientation) — conflating who-you-date with what-they-have and giving trans/non-binary
  people generic fallbacks; worse, the resolved **label WAS the answer key**, so editing gender/orientation
  orphaned prior ratings. **Decisions (asked, owner-confirmed):** proceed with the redesign (diagnosis gate §1
  could not be met — the reporter's vault is encrypted behind the app Keychain, unreachable from the build env;
  the redesign fixes both the model flaw and the read-path regardless, so I did NOT ship an unverified
  single-cause guess); **Option A** matrix key model; anatomy questions live **inside the `getSpecific`** opt-in
  group; **casual/euphemistic wording** (not clinical "genitals"). Built: **`MatrixRowSchema`** (`string | {key,
label}`) + `matrixRowKey`/`matrixRowLabel` in core `schemas.ts` — questionnaire matrices keep plain-string rows
  (key === label, byte-identical); a rewritten anatomy-driven `activityRows.ts` (`ActivityRowContext` =
  `{ownAnatomy, partnerAnatomy}`, returns `MatrixRow[]` with **stable keys** `oral-receiving`/`oral-giving-penis`
  /`-vulva`/`oral-giving` + a `slugifyActivity` key per universal act/dynamic; `LEGACY_ACTIVITY_KEY_MAP`/
  `legacyKeyFor`/`migrateActivityMatrixValue` for pre-46 carry-forward, idempotent, no-data-loss, no
  `schemaVersion` bump); two **18+/`restricted`** catalog questions — `ownAnatomy` single _"What are you packing
  down there?"_ (Cock (penis) / Pussy (vulva) / Both or intersex / Rather not say) + `partnerAnatomy` multi
  _"What do you like a partner to have down there?"_ (Cock (penis) / Pussy (vulva) / Don't mind); wired through
  `activityContext` (reads anatomy from the intimacy section, not cross-section gender), `formatAnswerForSynthesis`
  (legacy-migrate scoped to the `activities` matrix, then key→label), core `answering.ts`
  (`isAnswered`/`formatAnswerForDisplay` by stable key), `questionnaires/trends.ts`, the `@selfos/answering` matrix
  render, `IntakeFormPanel` (live re-resolve from the anatomy answers + migrate the seeded value; dropped
  `profileGender`), `Onboarding.tsx` (dropped the gender read), `QuestionnaireBuilder` (edits rows by label).
  Anatomy is a `restricted` intake answer only — never a `Person` field, never in `buildDepictionNote`, never
  broadcast-shareable; `gender` stays a basics identity field, `drawnTo` standalone coaching context.
  Code-reviewer **ship** (privacy rails, migration idempotency/no-loss, Option-A additivity verified; applied the
  one nit — scope the legacy re-key to the `activities` matrix so a future intake matrix can't be silently
  re-keyed). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **757 core + 11 relay + 803 desktop** unit (+resolver truth
  table incl. the trans/nb-erasure regression + drawnTo-decoupling, +stable-key/slug/migration units, +synthesis
  stable-key & legacy carry-forward, +`IntakeFormPanel` live-resolve & no-orphan RTL), full E2E (the comprehensive
  onboarding flow drives the anatomy answers → asserts the #62 wrong row is absent → decrypts the matrix value
  keyed by STABLE keys; + a focused **edit-anatomy-without-orphaning** regression with the 390px matrix guard).
  Synced specs 46 (→ Built), 27 §4.2/§5/§7, 18 §14.5, 08 (`Question.matrix` rows). NOTE: `site/index.html` is
  prettier-unclean on `main` already (no CI format job; lint-staged only checks staged files) — pre-existing,
  left untouched. **Lesson: when a feature uses the resolved display LABEL as the persisted answer KEY, any
  re-resolution (an anatomy/gender edit) orphans prior ratings — split a stable `{key}` from the `{label}` and
  migrate legacy label-keyed answers read-time; and asking anatomy DIRECTLY (a `restricted` question) beats
  inferring it from gender/orientation, which both conflates concepts and erases trans/non-binary users.**

  `ALLOWED_IMAGE_MIME`/`MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`, the 08 §13.2 `encryptBytes` envelope generalized — surfaced only in
  Sessions, §12); additive `ChatMessage.attachments` (`AttachmentRefSchema`, **no schemaVersion bump**); widened
  `ClaudeMessage.content` to `string | ContentBlock[]` + a `flattenContent` helper, with BOTH transports
  (`anthropicClient` + the iOS `browserClaudeClient`) mapping image blocks to the SDK; `chatService`'s async
  vision mapper that **re-reads stored bytes host-side every turn** (Claude is stateless) and **skips a
  missing/corrupt attachment** so the turn still completes; metered as the existing `chat` event (no new usage
  type); `deleteConversation` purges the sibling attachments folder. IPC seam
  (`conversation:storeAttachment`/`:getAttachment`/`:exportAttachment` + `chatStream attachments?`), gated
  `sessions.own` + **path-scoped to the active person's named conversation in the bridge** (a path can't reach
  another person's/conversation's attachment); mime+size re-validated in main; the 5-cap re-enforced server-side.
  Renderer: client-side `downscaleImage` (canvas re-encode also strips EXIF), an **opt-in** `Composer`
  (`allowAttachments`) with paste/drop/file-picker + pending thumbnails + calm 5-cap/unsupported errors (so the
  shared Composer stays text-only on dream/intake surfaces), `MessageAttachments` grid, the `AttachmentThumb` +
  `Lightbox` design-system primitives (→ `/gallery`), `conversationStore` store-on-send + an attachment-url cache
  - "Save image" export. Code-review fixes applied. Gate green: typecheck (all packages), lint, format, **740
    core + 794 desktop** unit (+media core, +conversation attachments, +vision mapping both clients + fake flatten,
    +chatService vision/re-supply/missing-skip, +`scaledDimensions`, +Composer/AttachmentThumb/Lightbox/
    MessageAttachments RTL), + an E2E (attach → AES-GCM envelope on disk + PNG-magic decrypt → bubble thumbnail →
    lightbox + export-outside-vault → delete-purges-folder → 390px guard); sessions/guided E2E green. Synced spec
    45 (→ Built) + 05 (ChatMessage/ClaudeMessage amendment) + 01 (Lightbox/AttachmentThumb). Did the work in a
    `git worktree` since a concurrent agent is touching the shared IPC seam files (§11.1). **Lesson: widening a
    shared host type (`ClaudeMessage.content` → a union) ripples into every inline test fake that read `.content`
    as a string — a `flattenContent(content)` helper fixes them all; Electron's `createImageBitmap` rejects some
    hand-picked 1×1 PNG blobs, so build a real PNG (zlib IDAT + CRC32) for an attachment E2E; and the strict CSP
    blocks `fetch('data:…')` but `img-src 'self' data:` lets data-URL thumbnails render.**
- 2026-06-24 — **Fix (Questionnaires AI "Suggested" STILL hit "The suggestion set came back in an unexpected
  shape" — a SECOND root cause spec 37's fix missed; user-reported; on `fix/gap-finder-suggestion-shape`).**
  Diagnosed (not assumed) by tracing the parse path: the MALFORMED message fires when the gap-finder's Claude
  call SUCCEEDS but zero usable suggestions survive parsing — two compounding causes. **(1)** the prompt bug —
  `GAP_FINDER_SYSTEM` said _"Use the same answer types as generation"_ but never listed them (the model never
  sees the generation prompt in that call), so the live model guessed invalid `AnswerType` values
  ("text"/"scale"/"open"); **(2)** the INNER `questions` array on `QuestionnaireSuggestionSchema` was still
  strict (spec 37 only loosened `required` + the OUTER array), so one off-spec sample `type` failed the whole
  suggestion → with every suggestion losing one question the batch went empty → MALFORMED. Fix: one shared
  `SUGGESTABLE_ANSWER_TYPES` constant (`schemas.ts`) feeds the generation guide, the gap-finder prompt (now
  names the exact enum values), AND the parse (`SuggestionQuestionSchema.type` = the suggestable subset, so an
  authoring-only `matrix`/`roster` sample drops rather than seeding a broken builder draft); the gap-finder
  parses with a per-element-tolerant inner `questions` array (37 §3.1) so a bad sample question drops only
  itself + a suggestion with one good + one bad question survives; `type`/`rationale` tolerate omission (only
  a `title` + ≥1 usable question are required). Both offline fakes made imperfect (a mixed valid/off-spec
  sample question, 37 §10) so the E2E exercises the salvage. Tests: a regression where 3 suggestions each mix
  a valid + an off-spec `type` → all 3 kept (was 0), a prompt-lists-the-types guard, a missing-`type`/
  `rationale` tolerance case, and the Suggested E2E asserts the off-spec sample question is dropped while its
  sibling + the suggestion survive. Code-reviewer **ship**. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **727 core +
  769 desktop** unit, questionnaire E2E green. Synced spec 37 §12. **Lesson: a prompt that references a list
  it doesn't include ("same types as generation") leaves the model guessing invalid enum values — inline the
  enum; and the spec-37 tolerance must reach NESTED arrays (the inner `questions`), not just the top-level
  batch, or one bad child still sinks the whole parent.**
- 2026-06-24 — **Fix — collapsible life-area portrait (user-reported "IT LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME"; on
  `fix/onboarding-sharing-ux`).** My flat grouping (faint gray uppercase headers + dividers) was too subtle to
  register as an improvement — the user still saw a wall of gray facts. **This time I showed an interactive
  MOCKUP (the `visualize` tool) of a bolder direction and got explicit sign-off BEFORE building** — the right
  move after repeated misses. Built: the long portrait now renders **collapsible life-area sections** — each a
  button header with a per-area icon, fact count, a "private" badge when it holds restricted facts, and a
  chevron — that expand on demand; **sensitive sections (any restricted fact) start COLLAPSED by default**
  (user-confirmed) so intimacy/trauma isn't on screen at a glance. Short insights stay a flat list. Verified
  with real Playwright screenshots (collapsed + expanded). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, 724 core + 11
  relay + 769 desktop unit, full E2E. **Lesson: when "improve the UI/UX" feedback recurs, stop iterating
  blindly — show a concrete visual mockup and get the user to pick the DIRECTION before coding. A subtle
  restyle reads as "no change"; the user wanted a structural rethink (collapse the wall into navigable
  sections), which a mockup surfaces in one round instead of three failed PRs.**
- 2026-06-24 — **Fix — UX redesign of the Memory portrait + onboarding sharing (user-reported "greatly
  improve the UI/UX", twice; on `fix/onboarding-sharing-ux`).** The prior fix removed the chips but the
  surfaces were still poor and I'd done NO visual QA — the user (rightly) called it out. **Memory portrait
  card** was an unreadable wall of ~40 tiny gray facts with "sensitive" tags floating on their own
  right-aligned "blank" lines (`.factControls margin-left:auto` + `flex-wrap` wrapped the tag onto a new
  line). Redesigned: a long multi-area insight (the portrait) now **groups facts by life-area** with small
  uppercase headers (`groupFactsByArea`); facts are a clean **list with hairline dividers** + readable text;
  tags flow **inline right after the text**. **Onboarding sharing control** floated top-right of the prompt
  (`.sharingSlot margin-left:auto`), leaving a big empty gap, and the inline sensitive-confirm rendered there
  too; moved it to its **own line directly under the prompt, left-aligned**. **Verified with real Playwright
  screenshots** (seed a 24-fact portrait → screenshot Memory; open onboarding → screenshot the form) — the
  visual QA I'd skipped. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **724 core + 11 relay + 768 desktop** unit, full
  E2E. **Lesson: "greatly improve the UI/UX" is not satisfied by removing a control — it means LOOKING at the
  rendered result and redesigning for readability (grouping, dividers, typography, inline-not-floating tags).
  Do real visual QA (a seeded Playwright screenshot you actually open and judge), not just "tests pass" — a
  green suite says the data is right, not that the screen is readable.**
- 2026-06-24 — **Fix (onboarding sharing was broken end-to-end — user-reported; on
  `fix/onboarding-sharing-end-to-end`).** The user (rightly frustrated) found three connected bugs the
  "comprehensive" sharing E2E had MISSED — because it seeded `Insight`s with `shareableTypes` already set and
  asserted the gate, never driving the real onboarding→synthesis→Memory path. **(1) Share-by-default never
  reached EXISTING portraits.** `factScopeForSection` (+ the answer readers) returned `[]` for any section
  with no `answerSharing`, and `answerSharing` is only written on (re-)submit — so a portrait synthesized
  before per-question sharing showed **everything "Private"** in Memory, the Sharing card said "not sharing
  anything yet," and nothing flowed to a partner. Fix (user chose **auto-backfill**): a new pure
  `effectiveAnswerScope(sectionId, qid, answerSharing)` resolves a **missing** entry for an _answered_
  question to its **category default** (an explicit choice, incl. an explicit `[]` = Private, still wins;
  restricted answers default `[]`), wired into `factScopeForSection`, `buildSharedIntakeAnswerLines`, and
  `listOutboundSharing` — so existing portraits share by default (answers immediately, facts on the next
  refresh). **(2) The onboarding picker "did nothing"** on a sensitive question — the opt-in confirm rendered
  as a Banner at the **top of the section**, far off-screen from the popover; now it renders **inline in the
  question's (or bulk) sharing slot**, replacing the picker. **(3) Memory clutter** — onboarding facts carried
  a read-only "Private" chip on _every_ line (a wall); removed (clean cards), while AI-inferred facts keep a
  discreet `FactSharingControl` (you still need to share a session/dream insight). Sharing is otherwise seen +
  controlled in the "Manage sharing" panel (now populated by the backfill). **E2E that would have caught it:**
  a new test seeds a **pre-spec portrait** (answers, NO `answerSharing`, facts with no `shareableTypes`) →
  asserts the partner's context gets the answer (decrypt), the Sharing summary reflects it, and cards are
  clean. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **724 core + 11 relay + 768 desktop** unit, **106 E2E**.
  **Lesson: an E2E that SEEDS the post-state (insights with `shareableTypes` set) tests the gate, not the
  feature — drive the real producer path (onboarding form → submit → synthesis → Memory) AND the existing-data
  path (a portrait from before the feature), or a whole class of "it doesn't work for real users" bugs slips
  through green. And "share by default" must backfill EXISTING data, not just newly-submitted sections.**
- 2026-06-24 — **Audit + fix (relationship-scoped sharing specs 42–44 post-merge review; on
  `fix/relationship-sharing-audit-followups`, PR pending).** A complete audit of the merged 42/43/44 work
  (privacy gate, context-assembly, trust boundary, E2E) — the core boundary (`factSharedWithViewer` +
  `relationshipTypesFromSubjectToViewer`, reused by `summarizeForContext`/`listRelatedShareableInsights`)
  is airtight: restricted/flagged short-circuit, fail-closed, partner-vs-sibling guarded by a decrypt-level
  E2E. The `code-reviewer` agent + an independent read found **3 should-fixes**, all fixed: **(1)**
  `buildLinkedPeopleContext` (the **dreams** linked-people context) bypassed the centralized gate — it now
  routes through `factSharedWithViewer` (honoring `shareableTypes`, excluding `flaggedInaccurate` — a
  **pre-existing** leak on the dreams surface) **and emits the §3.4 confidentiality preamble**, so "shared ≠
  shown" holds on dreams too. **(2)** Memory's per-fact scope picker was editable for **onboarding** facts,
  whose scope is **derived from `answerSharing`** and recomputed on re-synthesis → a Memory edit silently
  reverted (could **re-widen** a narrowed scope); intake facts are now **read-only** in the card + SharingPanel
  (change via "Edit answer", the single source of truth). **(3)** a corrupt scope now **fails closed** —
  `InsightFact.shareableTypes` + `IntakeSection.answerSharing` gained `.catch(undefined)`, so a malformed
  value degrades to own-only instead of throwing out of a related viewer's whole `buildContext`. Plus nits:
  removed a non-null `!` (CLAUDE.md §4) and deduped the inverse-type map into a single
  `INVERSE_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE` in `@selfos/core/sharing`. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **719 core + 11
  relay + 768 desktop** unit (+4), **105 E2E**. **Lesson: when a feature centralizes a privacy gate into one
  function, grep EVERY context-assembly caller and migrate them all — `buildLinkedPeopleContext` was left on
  the old inline filter, so the new relationship-type scoping AND the confidentiality rule silently didn't
  apply on the dreams surface; and a derived value (an intake fact's scope, from `answerSharing`) must not get
  an independent editable control that a recompute silently reverts.**
- 2026-06-24 — **Build (Memory dashboard overhaul — SPEC 44 BUILT; on `feat/memory-dashboard-overhaul`, PR
  pending).** The Memory half of the relationship-sharing group (consumes spec 42, amends spec 20) — making
  Memory **readable, consumable, and trustworthy**. **(1) Stats summary header** (`StatsSummary` + pure
  `stats.ts` derivations — `overviewStats`/`confidenceStats`/`sharingStats`): "SelfOS knows N things" by source +
  last-updated · a confidence distribution (text + a non-colour-only bar) · "you're sharing M things — Partner
  (k) …" with a **Manage sharing →** link (from `memory:outboundSharing`); shown only when there's something to
  summarize. **(2) Trends promoted to the top**, open by default (was a collapsed `<details>` at the bottom).
  **(3) Split-by-source corrections** in `InsightCard`: an ONBOARDING (`intake`) insight gets **Edit answer**
  (deep-links to the originating section via `provenance.intakeSection` → onboarding `openSection`) + Delete and
  **no flag** (you fix what you told us by editing the answer); an AI-INFERRED insight keeps the correction
  toggle, **relabelled "This isn't right about me"** (clear `aria-label`, not a bare flag icon). **(4) Per-fact
  sharing** swaps the broadcast `ShareToggle` for the spec-42 `RelationshipScopePicker` (`FactSharingControl`) —
  a legacy broadcast fact reads as "shared with all your relationship types," narrowable; a `restricted`
  sensitive fact shows a sensitive chip + the **deliberate two-step** (confirm → choose a type) that un-restricts
  AND scopes in one write (the 42 §8 "two explicit acts," never a default). **(5) `/memory/sharing` transparency
  surface** (`SharingPanel`) — every shared item + its scope + the concrete recipients ("Shared with Partner ·
  reaching Pat"), each editable in place. **Owner decision (asked, 2026-06-24): intake answers are scope-editable
  in place** (resolving the spec's §3.5↔§6 gap) → new **`intake:setAnswerSharing`** channel + `setIntakeAnswerSharing`
  core fn (gated `intake.own`, active-person-scoped; empty ⇒ Private). Extended the `insights:update` facts
  contract with additive `shareableTypes`/`restricted` (merged by id server-side, so a normal edit preserves
  them — a sensitive fact can ONLY be un-restricted by the explicit two-step). Extracted a shared
  `availableRelationshipTypesFor` helper (Memory/SharingPanel/onboarding — DRY). Code-reviewer **fix-first**
  (privacy boundary verified airtight; applied: hide the sharing picker on a flagged fact [it can't reach anyone
  anyway] + a store-level multi-fact `setFactScope` unit test). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **715 core +
  11 relay + 768 desktop** unit (+stats, +StatsSummary, +FactSharingControl, +SharingPanel, +insightStore
  setFactScope, +setIntakeAnswerSharing core, +2 coreBridge: scope-to-partner/un-restrict + answer scope),
  **105 E2E** (+1: stats header → type-scope a fact to partner [decrypt reaches partner, not the sibling] →
  "not right" [decrypt absent from own context] → Manage sharing surface → Edit answer deep-link; 360px guards on
  Memory + the sharing panel). Visual QA at desktop + 360px (real Electron screenshots: stats row, trends-at-top,
  the sharing panel with scope chips + recipients). Synced spec 44 (→ Built) + 20 (amended). **Lesson:
  `updateInsight` REPLACES the facts array with the patch, so a per-fact scope edit must send EVERY fact (the
  changed one + the rest minimal, preserved by merge-by-id) or it silently drops the siblings; and a still-open
  `RelationshipScopePicker` popover overlays a sibling row's control — an E2E must close it (Escape) before the
  next click or the click times out (the trace's last action localized it).**
- 2026-06-24 — **Build (onboarding per-question sharing — SPEC 43 BUILT; on `feat/onboarding-scoped-sharing`,
  PR pending).** The onboarding half of the relationship-sharing group (consumes spec 42's model). Each intake
  **form question now carries a relationship-type sharing chip** (the spec-42 `RelationshipScopePicker`),
  **shared-by-default** per category presets (restricted intimacy/trauma ⇒ Private), with a **per-section bulk
  control** (+ "Mixed"), the honest **"informs their AI, never shown to them"** explainer, a **sensitive-opt-in
  confirm**, and a one-tap **"refresh your portrait"** after an edit — so the marriage/sex-counseling case
  ("my partner's AI can use this, not my coworker's") is expressible in the flow. **Core:** new pure
  `@selfos/core/intake/sharingCategory.ts` (`SECTION_SHARING_CATEGORY` + `defaultScopeForQuestion`/
  `questionCategory`/`questionDefaultsPrivate`; `IntakeFormQuestion.category?` additive); `submitSectionForm(…,
sharing?)` writes `IntakeSection.answerSharing` (defaulting every answered question from its preset);
  `synthesizePortrait` tags each fact's `shareableTypes` via `factScopeForSection` — the **most-restrictive
  INTERSECTION** of the section's per-question scopes, read **only** from explicit `answerSharing` (a pre-spec
  section merely re-synthesized stays own-only — no surprise broadcast), with the normal-vs-"(sensitive)"
  candidate split mirroring `formAnswersMessages`; a `restricted` fact stays restricted unless its answers are
  opted in (then non-restricted + type-scoped). Intake facts still **never broadcast** (`shareable:false`) —
  `shareableTypes` is the only share path. **IPC:** `intake:submitForm` carries `sharing` (Zod-validated +
  active-person-scoped in the bridge). **`@selfos/answering`** gains an optional **render-prop** `sharing:
{ renderControl(questionId) }` (the package stays free of the app design-system; the host renders the picker),
  rendered in a `flex-wrap` question header row (no inner scrollbar at 360px) — **questionnaires pass nothing →
  unchanged**. Code-reviewer **fix-first** (one should-fix: the per-section **bulk** control bypassed the §8
  sensitive confirm for a restricted question inside a non-restricted section [health/substances] — now confirms
  when sharing any sensitive default-private question; +RTL test; +documented the bounded model-attribution
  residual in §8). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **714 core + 751 desktop + 11 relay** unit, **104 E2E**
  (+1: scope basics → Partner → decrypt `answerSharing` + the fact's `shareableTypes` → the partner's context
  has the fact behind the confidentiality preamble, the sibling's has neither; 360px overflow guard). Synced
  spec 43 (→ Built) + 18 (§8.3 default is now per-question). **Lesson: the promoted PROFILE field (e.g.
  `occupation`) keeps its independent spec-15 field-share (shared to all related by default) — spec 43 only
  governs the intake ANSWER + the derived FACT, so the spec-43 E2E signal is the fact text + the confidentiality
  preamble, never the bare promoted value (which leaks to all relatives via spec 15); and the picker chip's
  accessible name starts with the question prompt, so a `getByLabel('<prompt>')` collides — target the textbox
  role or use `{exact:true}` (the recurring substring-collision footgun).**
- 2026-06-24 — **Audit + fixes (specs 37–41 post-merge review; on `fix/audit-37-41-followups`, PR open).** A
  deep audit of the five merged specs (one code-reviewer per spec) surfaced **1 BLOCKER + several should-fixes**,
  all now fixed with tests on a branch (full gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **700 core + 11 relay + 745
  desktop** unit; E2E 103/103 — the lone `dreams: link a household person` failure is a pre-existing
  Playwright-Electron timing flake that passes in isolation, unrelated to these changes). Fixes: **(spec 40
  BLOCKER — privacy leak)** the cross-feature synthesis digest never ran insights through the context-feed
  boundary, so a **muted dream** (`informsContext:false`) and **wholly-flagged** insights leaked into the AI
  pass — it now filters via the newly-exported `feedableInsights` + skips wholly-flagged summaries, mirroring
  `summarizeForContext` exactly (the docstring already CLAIMED this; the code didn't). **(spec 41)** the Claude +
  OpenAI **API keys rendered "Synced across devices"** — they're device-local secrets; added `scope:'device'` to
  `ai.apiKey`/`ai.test`/`dreams.imageApiKey`/`dreams.imageTest` (+ a `__resetBuiltins()` test hook + regression
  test — the gap that let it ship). **(spec 37 — safety)** a **TRUNCATED** session-analysis reply was salvaged to
  a summary-only insight, silently dropping the trailing `crisisFlag`; it now reports `TRUNCATED` (a retry) so the
  flag can surface, matching the dream path — a complete-but-malformed reply still salvages (`classifyParseFailure`
  gate); also escaped the field name in `salvageJsonObjectField`. **(spec 39)** auto-reconcile **stamped its 24h
  throttle before the AI/budget gate**, so a transient AI-off/over-budget/**stream-ERROR** launch suppressed the
  cadence for 24h — the stamp moved to AFTER the pass and is skipped for the no-spend reasons (AI_OFF/BUDGET/ERROR)
  while a billed-but-unparseable pass still stamps (no re-spend). **(spec 38 — test gap)** added a bridge test
  proving **re-ask auto-revokes the prior relay link** (the old link → 404, the anti-double-submit §3.6 claim that
  was previously asserted only by a comment). **Then fixed the two items first flagged for a decision (owner: "fix
  anything that needs to be addressed"):** (39 §4.4) goals were **double-grounded** into coaching context — once as
  legacy `Goal:` insight facts AND via the new "Open commitments" line; now the `Goal:` facts are EXCLUDED from the
  subject's own-context emit (a shared `GOAL_FACT_PREFIX` in insightStore), so a goal reaches the coach once (the
  structured line, which carries status/due/staleness) — the facts stay on the insight for the Sessions wrap-up
  card + per-fact sharing, and a goal SHARED with another person still reaches their context. (40 §3.4/§11-Q4) added
  the resolved **proactivity-specific per-week synthesis cap** (`SYNTHESIS_WEEKLY_CAP=7`, rolling 7-day count of
  `coaching.synthesize` events, new `CAPPED` reason, owner-override bypass) so the manual "Look again" path can't run
  away on cost. +tests for both (no double-ground in assembled context + a goal still reaches a sharee; the 8th
  weekly pass is CAPPED with no spend). **Lesson: a digest/grounding
  builder that reads insights directly must run them through the SAME `feedableInsights` boundary as
  `summarizeForContext`, or muted/flagged content leaks into an AI pass — a docstring claiming the boundary isn't
  the boundary; and a throttle/cooldown must be stamped only after a pass that actually SPENT, never before the
  availability gate, or a transient blip silences the cadence for the whole window.**
- 2026-06-24 — **Build (discoverability, empty states & first-run polish — SPEC 41 BUILT, all 5 slices; on
  `feat/discoverability-empty-states`, PR pending).** A renderer-only UX polish pass to make the app
  self-explaining. **§11 resolved with the owner first (recorded in spec 41 §11):** full empty-state audit;
  one-time tips ship (gap-finder + depth invitations); proposed role-aware AI copy; a small text scope badge;
  orientation = a dismissible Home card + an account-menu re-open; nav left as-is; dismissals per-person +
  per-device. **Slice 1 (highest-value):** one `AiUnavailableNotice` component + `aiUnavailableMessage` helper
  — the single source of truth for role-aware AI-unavailable copy (owner → "Set up Claude in **Settings → AI**"
  link; member → "ask the person who set up this household to turn it on" — generic, never names the owner,
  never implies a key; offline → a connection line for both; unknown role → the **safer member** copy) — swapped
  onto **every** AI surface (Sessions launcher + composer, SuggestedSessions, the Draft-with-AI + Suggested
  panels, Memory refresh note, compatibility send + both Results, dream analysis + patterns, onboarding, and
  DreamImagePanel's member case). **Slice 2:** actionable, capability-gated empty states — Inbox (→ Create a
  questionnaire), Memory (→ "insights appear after analysis" + Start a session), Dreams-no-image (a calm "No
  image yet" distinct from the REFUSED/ERROR banners), Home (`DiscoveryNudge` for a near-empty person + a richer
  `GettingStarted` that also points at a guided session / dreams / a questionnaire), Dreams journal, People, and
  the Questionnaires list (the header-action surfaces use a differently-worded in-card CTA — "Add your first
  person" / "Log your first dream" — to avoid a duplicate-label collision). **Slice 3:** the `ScopeBadge`
  device-vs-synced signal on every setting (a borderless ghost label, visually + a11y-distinct from the bordered
  "Admin only" pill; both can sit on one row; `/gallery`). **Slice 4:** the first-run orientation
  (`WelcomeOrientationCard` "How SelfOS works" + the account-menu `AboutSelfOsDialog`, sharing `OrientationBody`
  - the not-medical line) and one-time `OneTimeTip`s on the gap-finder + depth invitations — backed by a new
    device-local, per-person `discovery:getDismissals`/`:setDismissals` seam (additive `DeviceState.discoveryDismissals`,
    keyed by the active person in the bridge — the trust boundary; the spec-35 precedent) + a `discoveryStore`
    reset/loaded in the AppShell per-person effect. **Slice 5:** 360px geometry guards. Gate green: typecheck,
    lint, format, **697 core + 754 desktop** unit (+ `AiUnavailableNotice`, `ScopeBadge`, discovery store/components,
    the per-person discovery coreBridge test, and updated empty-state/AI-copy assertions across ~10 suites), **E2E
    +4** (role-aware AI-unavailable owner-vs-member, Inbox → builder, the scope signal, orientation
    appears→dismiss→re-open→relaunch-gone). Visual QA at desktop (orientation card + not-medical line, the Synced /
    This device badges, the discovery nudge). Synced spec 41 (→ Built), 01 (`ScopeBadge`/`OneTimeTip`), 02 (the
    account-menu items), 03 (the scope-signal note). **Lesson: a "fix the AI-unavailable copy everywhere" task is
    really a centralization task — one role-aware component swapped onto every surface beats N hand-rolled strings,
    and the owner/member split must be the trust-aware one (a member never sees a key prompt or owner-naming, and
    an unknown role falls to the safer member copy). The macOS traffic-light inset makes the titlebar wider than a
    360px window in E2E, but that inset doesn't exist on the real 360px target (iOS), so the established 360px guard
    is the `overflow-x:auto|scroll` element scan (excluding the intentional settings section-nav pill row) + a
    `main`-width check, NOT a document-width assertion.**

  registry) + `ProactivityControl`. **Slice 2 (crisis, no-AI):** `aggregateCrisisSignal` (renderer-computed,
  the `hasRecentCrisis` precedent — no IPC channel) + a Home `CrisisSupportBanner` (non-dismissible,
  resources-first, independent of the mood chart; supersedes the WellbeingCard's session-only banner). **Slice 3
  (the one extra AI spend):** `coachingSynthesisService` (`synthesize`/`getSynthesis`/pure
  `shouldSynthesize`/`countNewInsights`) + `CoachingSynthesis` cache + `coaching.synthesize` usage type +
  per-person device-state throttle marker; tolerant-parse + **meter-before-parse**; digest is structured-only
  (own insights' summaries + **non-restricted/non-flagged** facts + dream stats, never transcripts); a cadence
  hook + `synthesisStore` + Home `InsightOfTheWeekCard` ("Talk it through" seeds a session via a Composer
  `initialText` handoff). **Slice 4 (goal nudges):** the `goal-followup` notification kind + source (≤1,
  stalest-first, onChange) + Home `GoalFollowupCard` (Still on it / Mark done / Let it go → `goals:setStatus`;
  a tracked goal now counts toward "not new"). **Slice 5 (coordination):** the `coaching-synthesis` notification
  kind + the same-area yield to depth/freshness; phone-width overflow polish (`.cardHead` flex-wrap + `Inline`
  wrap). Code-reviewer **ship after one should-fix** (the synthesis EMPTY gate now counts RECENT in-window
  insights so an all-stale history can't bill an empty digest; +per-person setting scope `device`; honest
  `AI_OFF`). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **697 core + 11 relay + 715 desktop** unit, **99 E2E** (+4).
  Synced spec 40 (→ Built; the two as-built deviations recorded). **Lesson: a synthesis/EMPTY gate must use the
  SAME recency window the digest does (counting all-time approved insights let an all-stale history pay for an
  empty pass); and a per-person preference belongs in a `CoachingPrefs` file read in the bridge, not the
  household/device settings registry — its `vault`/`device` scopes can't express per-active-person, so the
  registry entry stays inert while the custom control owns the real state via `coaching:get/setPrefs`.**
- 2026-06-24 — **Feedback — HARD RULE (forceful): ALWAYS create _AND RUN_ E2E to verify work — never defer or
  skip it.** I shipped spec 38's PR with E2E "pending on-machine verification" on a bogus "needs a display"
  excuse. The user corrected this firmly. E2E **runs headlessly here**: `pnpm --filter @selfos/desktop exec
electron-vite build` once, then `pnpm exec playwright test [-g "<name>"]` (the `_electron.launch` harness needs
  no visible display — proven by running the existing suite + 2 new spec-38 tests, **90/90 green**). Sharpened
  CLAUDE.md §7 DoD (the E2E item now leads with "ALWAYS WRITE AND RUN; a slice is NOT done until its E2E is
  green"). Wrote the missing spec-38 E2E (draft-vs-ready + branch validation through the real builder UI; and the
  full discoverability→export flow: seed a submitted **Private** send → the `responses-arrived` notification names
  the responder → "View results" deep-links to Results → **Export CSV writes a real file outside the vault** and
  the assertion confirms the numeric value is present but the **Private prose is absent**). On
  `feat/questionnaire-lifecycle` (PR [#47]). **Lesson: E2E is runnable in this environment — the "no display"
  claim was wrong; build once then `playwright test`, and treat green E2E as a non-negotiable gate, not a TODO.**

- 2026-06-23 — **Build (living memory & continuity — SPEC 39 BUILT, all 5 slices; on

  only on a manual "Refresh"), goals were just `Goal: …` text facts (no follow-through), and two share-cleanup
  leaks existed. **§11 resolved with the owner first (all recommendations confirmed):** auto-reconcile on
  threshold(≥5 new insights)+gap(>14d) at launch/focus, 24h device-local per-person throttle,
  `memory.autoReconcile` opt-out (default on); **confirm-before-apply merges** (propose-only → "Needs your
  review"); a **new `@selfos/core/goals` store** + `GoalSchema` (open/inProgress/done/stale/abandoned); stale =
  past-due OR ≥21d untouched (derived, persisted on confirm); flag strips share + `retractedShareAt`; legacy
  retro-tag via no-AI `SECTION_LIFE_AREA`/keyword map during reconcile; a bounded "open commitments" grounding
  line in `summarizeForContext`. **Slice 1 (cleanup):** `reapOrphanShares` on `people:delete` + share-retraction
  on `flagInsightFact` (closes §1 C1/C2). **Slice 2 (goals backend):** `goalService` (extract/de-dup/setStatus/
  update/delete + pure `isGoalStale`/`effectiveGoalStatus`), wired into `sessionAnalysisService` (no extra
  spend), `goals:*` IPC gated `memory.own` + active-person scoped. **Slice 3 (goals UI):** the Memory **Goals &
  commitments** section + `GoalCard` + `GoalStatusChip` (→ `/gallery`) + per-person `goalStore`; a gentle stale
  "still working on it?" prompt. **Slice 4 (auto-reconcile):** `shouldAutoReconcile` + `useMemoryReconcile`
  cadence + `memory:refresh({auto})` (calm `SKIPPED` no-op when not warranted) + `MergeProposal` store +
  `memory:reconcileState`/`memory:resolveProposal` + the "Memory last tidied …" signal; reconciliation now
  **queues** merge proposals instead of silently folding (confidence/category still auto-applies). **Slice 5
  (retro-tag):** `retroTagLegacyPortraits` rides any reconcile pass — **prefers `Emotions & patterns`** when a
  legacy distress fact also matches an earlier-ordered keyword (the §28/§8 never-narrow-distress invariant, the
  code-reviewer's one should-fix). All schemas additive-optional (no migration). Code-reviewer **ship** (privacy/

  §3.5/§4.3 (amended: reconciliation is cadence-gated + confirm-before-apply). **Lesson: a no-AI keyword
  retro-tagger picks the FIRST taxonomy match, which silently demotes a distress fact off the always-on CORE
  guarantee if an earlier-ordered area (Work/Money) also matches — mirror the emotions-first safety rule
  (`selectPortraitFacts`) and prefer `Emotions & patterns` whenever it's among the matches; and "confirm-before-

- 2026-06-23 — **Build (AI output robustness & honest failures — SPEC 37 BUILT; on `feat/ai-output-robustness`,
  PR open).** A whole class of bugs came from brittle handling of Claude's JSON: an all-or-nothing `safeParse`
  that drops a good batch over one bad element, a strict `.parse` that nukes an otherwise-perfect result over one
  off-spec field, and messages that **blame the user's data** when the real cause was a parse failure / truncation
  / refusal. **Fixed the reported gap-finder bug** end-to-end ("No suggestions… add more about the people" fired
  AFTER a successful call because `QuestionnaireSuggestionSchema.questions[].required` was `z.boolean()` [the model
  omits it] + an all-or-nothing array parse + a data-blame message). Built ONE shared `@selfos/core/ai/jsonSalvage`
  utility (the §11 "centralize" decision): non-throwing `extractJsonObject`/`extractJsonArray`, a string-aware
  balanced-brace `salvageJsonArray`/`salvageJsonObjectArrayField` (generalizing the gold-standard portrait
  salvage) + `salvageJsonObjectField` (recover a leading essential string from a truncated object), a
  `tolerantArray(element, sentinel, keep)` Zod helper (per-element `.catch` → drop the bad, keep the rest), and
  `classifyParseFailure`/`aiFailureMessage`/`classifyParseOutcome` — an **honest taxonomy**: `TRUNCATED` (empty/
  unclosed → "cut off, try again"), `REFUSED` (refusal-prose, no JSON — **last-resort, never assumed first**),
  else `MALFORMED` ("unexpected shape"). Widened `AiFailureReason` (+`TRUNCATED`/`MALFORMED`) + the inline result
  unions; loosened the suggestion schema's `required` → optional; converted the strict draft schemas to tolerant
  (require only the essential field, `.catch` optionals, `tolerantArray` batches) and adopted the shared
  parse+classify across **gap-finder, generation, improve, variant, analysis, alignment, context-only distill,
  session analysis, dream synthesis, reconcile, the guided-suggest twin, and the portrait** (migrated onto the
  shared helpers). **Owner decisions (asked first, all recommendations):** proposed wording approved; show any
  partial (≥1); NO one-retry on TRUNCATED (no surprise spend); empty-context kept as a **PRE-CALL** check
  (`isThinContext` — the gap-finder hint fires without spending; a post-call zero is now an honest parse-outcome,
  never a data blame). **Invariants verified:** meter-before-parse preserved everywhere; `crisisFlag`/
  `distressSignal` preserved with `.catch(undefined)` (never coerced, never dropped by per-element salvage, §8);
  privacy boundaries untouched (salvage operates only on the reply). Offline fakes made **imperfect by default**
  (gap-finder fake omits `required`) so the suite exercises real salvage. Code-reviewer **ship** (meter-before-
  parse, crisis-signal, privacy, variant option-count safety all verified; applied the 2 nits — fixed a split
  comment + "suggestion set" noun so the message reads cleanly). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **599 core +
  11 relay + 660 desktop** unit (+27 shared-helper, +gap-finder regression [3 `required`-less → 3 shown, was 0],
  +per-service salvage/truncation/refusal cases, +`SuggestedPanel` RTL), **88/88 E2E** (+1 driving Suggested with
  an imperfect fake → suggestions appear, no data blame). Synced spec 37 (→ Built). **Lesson: a strict `.parse` on
  a model reply is the wrong contract — one off-spec optional field or one bad batch element must never discard an
  otherwise-usable result, and the parse boundary must own a balanced-brace salvage for truncation; classify a
  "no usable output" as TRUNCATED/MALFORMED first and REFUSED only on detected refusal-prose (never assume a
  refusal); and offline fakes that return flawless JSON HIDE this class of bug — make them imperfect by default.**
- 2026-06-23 — **Build (relationship-scoped sharing — the FOUNDATIONAL sharing model; SPEC 42 BUILT; on
  `feat/relationship-scoped-sharing`, PR open).** Sharing was all-or-nothing — a fact was broadcast to EVERY related
  person (`shareable:true`) or one person id (`shareableWith`), and ALL intake data was hardcoded own-context-only —
  so "share with my partner but never my parent/coworker" (the marriage/sex-counseling case) was inexpressible. Built
  the **read + model** (the producers/surfaces are specs 43/44): a fact/intake-answer now names the **relationship
  types** whose people's AI may use it, resolved against the **live graph at buildContext time**. Schema (additive,
  **no schemaVersion bump**): `InsightFact.shareableTypes` + `IntakeSection.answerSharing`. ONE pure gate
  `factSharedWithViewer(fact, viewer, grantedTypes)` in `schemas.ts` (broadcast ∨ per-person ∨ type-scope, **AND**
  not-`restricted` **AND** not-`flaggedInaccurate`) + a pure resolver `relationshipTypesFromSubjectToViewer`
  (parent↔child **inverse derivation**) + `scopeGrants` (`@selfos/core/people/relationshipScope`). `summarizeForContext`
  / `listRelatedShareableInsights` rewired onto the gate — the CALLER resolves `grantedTypes` + passes them in, so
  `insights` never imports `people`/`intake` (the cycle-avoidance pattern); shared **intake answers** read into a
  related person's context via `buildSharedIntakeAnswerLines` (imports the catalog by its **direct path**, not the
  barrel, to dodge the people↔intake cycle). The §3.4 **confidentiality preamble** prefixes any cross-shared block —
  "shared ≠ shown": the recipient's coach may USE but never quote/attribute/reveal it (the load-bearing
  couples-counseling guarantee). `SHARING_PRESETS` constant (partner=all; close family/friends=all-but-intimacy/trauma;
  coworker=basics/work/values; ex/other=nothing; intimacy/trauma=partner-only). Transparency: `listOutboundSharing` +
  the **own-scoped, `memory.own`-gated `memory:outboundSharing`** IPC (what you share + the concrete people receiving
  it). Renderer: a reusable **`RelationshipScopePicker`** (collapsed chip → popover checkbox list + "Private (only me)"
  - the honest explainer; `flex:none`, text/icon not colour-only, §12 dropdown handling) + shared copy
    (`describeScope`, `confidentialityPreamble`) in `@selfos/core/sharing` + `/gallery`. **Safety invariant (exhaustively
    tested):** a partner-scoped fact reaches the PARTNER, never a sibling/parent/coworker; a `restricted` fact reaches NO
    one even when type-scoped; a corrupt scope fails **closed**; removing the edge re-gates at read. Code-reviewer
    **ship** (privacy boundary + trust boundary + cycle safety all verified airtight; applied the one nit — name the
    author in the questionnaire-generation preamble). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **582 core + 11 relay + 663
    desktop** unit (resolver/`scopeGrants` truth table, partner-vs-sibling/restricted guard, transparency read,
    `RelationshipScopePicker` RTL, `memory:outboundSharing` gating) + a decrypt-level E2E privacy guard. **Lesson: when a
    shared file in a SHARED working tree holds BOTH your hunks and a concurrent agent's (here `schemas.ts` — they added a
    `TRUNCATED` `AiFailureReason` for spec 37), a whole-file `git diff` patch drags their half across; do feature work in
    a `git worktree`, and if a patch already captured a foreign hunk, `git checkout --` the file and re-apply ONLY your
    hunks. And keep the sharing gate as ONE pure predicate (`factSharedWithViewer`) the caller feeds resolved types into,
    so `insights` stays cycle-free and the boundary is defined exactly once.**
- 2026-06-23 — **Build (onboarding intimacy-matrix redesign — 5-point + gender/orientation-aware; spec 27 §4.2 +
  18 §14.5; on `feat/intimacy-matrix-redesign`, PR open).** Owner-approved decisions (implemented, not re-asked).
  The intake `activities` matrix went from a 3-state scale (Hard limit · Curious · Into it) to a **5-point ordered
  feeling scale — Hard no · Not interested · Curious · Like it · Love it** (one mutually-exclusive choice per row;
  **"Hard no" rendered as a BOUNDARY** with a distinct danger tone, the other four as feelings — a hard no is the
  strongest "no", not an extra toggle). Engine, all **additive** (no migration): `Question.matrix` gains
  **`pointLabels: string[]`** (N-label scale; wins over the legacy 3-label `min/mid/maxLabel`, existing numbered
  questionnaire matrices untouched) + **`limitLabels: string[]`** (boundary tone); `@selfos/answering`'s
  `ScalePicker` renders them (new `.scalePointLimit` style + a `--color-danger-subtle-bg` token, which the relay
  page already defined); `formatAnswerForSynthesis` maps points → `pointLabels`. The acts are
  **gender/orientation-aware at the RENDER layer only** via a pure `resolveIntakeActivityRows({ gender, drawnTo })`
  (`@selfos/core/intimacy/activityRows.ts`): **only the oral rows** are relabelled/split by anatomy — own anatomy
  → receiving label; partner anatomy from `drawnTo` → giving rows; **a straight man never sees the blowjob-giving
  variant**, a bi person sees both; **everything else stays universal** (no over-filtering). **Never erase on
  uncertainty:** any ambiguity in gender (non-binary/trans/PNTS/other/unset) OR `drawnTo`
  (everyone/non-binary/trans\*/other/empty) → the FULL list with neutral oral labels. The shared
  `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES` inventory is **NOT** mutated (questionnaire generation/spec 08 reads the same list);
  synthesis **re-resolves with the same `(gender, drawnTo)`** from the session (`activityContext.ts`) so stored
  matrix keys map back to labels, and **appends any orphaned stored keys verbatim** so a later gender/drawnTo edit
  never silently drops a prior rating. **Also fixed a real bug:** the onboarding renderer's `toSubmit` dropped the
  matrix (an object answer) so activity ratings never persisted — it now passes the row→point record through.
  Code-reviewer **ship** (resolver rules, render↔synthesis key consistency, inventory immutability, additive
  schema compat, and the privacy boundary all verified; applied the one should-fix — the orphaned-key hardening).
  Gate: typecheck, lint, format, **523 core + 11 relay + 650 desktop** unit; onboarding **E2E** drives the real UI
  (gender → drawnTo → 18+ gate → fill the gender-aware matrix → Continue → **decrypt** the persisted matrix value;
  asserts the blowjob-giving row is absent for a straight man) + a 390px no-overflow guard while the matrix renders;
  visual QA at desktop + 390px (the 5 points wrap cleanly, "Hard no" reads as a red boundary). Synced spec 27 +
  18 §14.5 + 08's `Question.matrix` interface. **Lesson: keep a per-person row tailoring at the RENDER layer (a
  pure resolver), never by mutating a SHARED inventory another feature reads; make render + synthesis resolve from
  the SAME persisted inputs so a relabelled row's answer key still maps back — and append orphaned keys so a later
  edit can't silently drop a rating. The matrix-as-display-string keying meant the renderer's object-dropping
  `toSubmit` had been silently discarding every activity rating — a "tests pass, data lost" trap a decrypt-the-
  value E2E catches where a render-only assertion didn't.**
- 2026-06-23 — **Build (update awareness, notify-only — SPEC 36 BUILT; on `feat/update-awareness`, PR open).** SelfOS
  had no way to tell a user a newer version exists. Built a notify-only check (NO auto-download/install, no
  electron-updater, no signing — the app stays unsigned): a pure `@selfos/core/updates` `checkForUpdate({fetch,
currentVersion, now})` does the **unauthenticated** GitHub `releases/latest` GET (the repo is now **public** — no
  token, ever; descriptive User-Agent, ~8s `AbortController` timeout, Zod-validated, semver-compared) → returns
  `UpdateCheckResult | null` where **null = couldn't check** and NEVER overwrites the cache (404/malformed tag → up
  to date; 403/network/timeout/unparseable → null). The network call is a **host primitive**
  (`BridgeHost.checkForUpdate`, `globalThis.fetch` in main, faked under `SELFOS_FAKE_UPDATE`); `coreBridge.updatesCheck`
  caches a SUCCESSFUL result device-local + `updatesGetState` reads it. **Cadence is renderer-driven** (a
  `useUpdateChecks` AppShell hook: launch + 6h + focus/visibility, gated by the `updates.autoCheck` device toggle
  [default ON], ~30min throttle for non-forced; manual button forces) rather than a main timer — simpler, and
  "cleared on quit" = the renderer effect cleanup. An app-global `updateStore` (NOT per-person reset) drives both the
  Settings → About control (idle/checking[`aria-busy`]/up-to-date/available[+ View release]/calm error, `role=status`)
  AND the spec-35 `update-available` notification (sticky warning toast; `external` action → the tag's `html_url` via
  `shell.openExternal`). **App-global dismiss** (§11): `APP_GLOBAL_NOTIFICATION_KEYS` + a `globalNotificationState`
  device blob the bridge splits/merges, so an update dismissal is shared across personas + survives a person switch
  (spec 35 was per-person-only). Corrected the now-stale "repo is private" notes in spec 19 + README (downloads are
  public; still unsigned → Gatekeeper bypass stays) + documented the GitHub update-check as the only non-Claude/
  non-relay outbound call. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **513 core + 647 desktop** unit; **83/83 E2E** (the
  default E2E env pins `SELFOS_FAKE_UPDATE=0.0.0` so no test hits real GitHub or raises a phantom update). Synced
  spec 36 (→ Built) + spec 35 (update-available un-stubbed). **Lesson: an update notice is app-GLOBAL, but spec 35's
  notification state is per-person — bridge a single `globalNotificationState` blob keyed by a known
  `APP_GLOBAL_NOTIFICATION_KEYS` set so dismiss is shared + survives a switch, rather than bolting global state onto
  the per-person store; and a default-on launch check that surfaces "You're up to date (vX.Y.Z)" collides with a
  bare `getByText(version)` E2E assert — anchor version matchers (`^v0\.4\.0`) so the new line doesn't break them.**
- 2026-06-23 — **Build (unified in-app notification system — SPEC 35 BUILT; on `feat/notification-system`).** SelfOS
  surfaced alerts ad-hoc (a sync-conflict `Banner`, a Home "keep your profile fresh" card, no signal when a
  questionnaire recipient responded). Built ONE framework — a `TitlebarControl` **bell** + unread badge → a
  **NotificationCenter** dropdown + corner **toasts** — and migrated four kinds: **sync-conflict**,
  **responses-arrived**, **profile-freshness** (all live) + **update-available** (registered but **stubbed** — no
  checker yet; spec 36 raises it). Notifications are **derived** in the renderer from live state (conflicts already
  on the AppHeader path; one-shot profile-suggestion + responses-arrived reads on mount/person-change — NO background
  polling); only read/dismissed **signatures** persist — **device-local + per-person** — via two device-state-backed
  channels `notifications:getState`/`:setState` (mirroring `sidebarCollapsed`), keyed by the active person IN THE
  BRIDGE (the trust boundary). A pure `resolveNotifications` registry coalesces to one item per `coalesceKey` and
  re-surfaces a dismissed item only when its condition CHANGES (`onIncrease` for conflicts/responses so resolving
  some never re-pops; set-gains-a-new-id for profile-freshness so a shrinking set never re-nags; `onChange` for
  update-available). **New seam beyond the spec:** a `reveal-vault` **action** for the sync-conflict "Resolve" (a
  shell op, not a route/URL — alongside navigate/external/none), a `notifications:responsesArrived` consumer read
  (gated `questionnaires.viewResults`, sender-scoped — counts submitted **and** analyzed so the tally is monotonic),
  and a `shell:openExternal` channel (http(s)-only) for the external action. Added a design-system **`Toast`**
  primitive (severity tones from `Banner` tokens, sticky-or-auto-dismiss with hover/focus pause, `aria-live`/
  `role=alert`; toasts clear once read/dismissed so a sticky one never lingers) + the bell/center/viewport chrome +
  a per-person-reset `notificationStore`; showcased in `/gallery`. Tightened `AppHeader` gaps + edge padding at phone
  width so the larger cluster (now incl. the bell) fits with **no horizontal scrollbar** (§12) — the fix had to sit
  AFTER the `767px` block to win at 390px, and stays less specific than the `win32` control-inset rule. Crisis stays
  OUT (untouched `CrisisFooter`); the in-content sync-conflict Banner + Home freshness card REMAIN as deep
  affordances. Code-reviewer **ship** (privacy/per-person/re-surface/a11y verified; applied both should-fixes —
  count analyzed responses + the profile-freshness set-gains-id comparator — and the viewResults-denial nit test).
  Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **637 desktop + core** unit; **81/81 E2E** (the prior household-AI-key flake
  now passes). Synced spec 35 (§3.4/§4/§6 + Built changelog) + spec 01 §5.6 (`Toast`). **Lesson: keep notifications
  DERIVED (recompute from live state) and persist only read/dismissed SIGNATURES per coalesce key — so dismissals
  survive a reload, never sync or leak across personas, and a per-kind re-surface rule (`onIncrease` /
  set-gains-id / `onChange`) decides re-popping with no stored notification log; and adding a control to the titlebar
  means re-checking the phone-width fit (the §12 overflow guard caught it).**
- 2026-06-23 — **Build (AI rich-text rendering — SPEC 34 BUILT; on `feat/rich-text-rendering`, PR opened).** Every
  AI-generated string was rendered as a plain text node, so the Markdown the model naturally writes (`**bold**`,
  `-`/`1.` lists, `###`, `>` quotes, `` `code` ``) showed as literal characters on the onboarding **portrait**,
  **coaching sessions**, and a dozen more surfaces. Built ONE shared **`<Markdown>`** primitive — a hand-rolled,
  dependency-free parser (`markdownParser.ts`, an AST → semantic elements) + the component — in **`@selfos/answering`**
  (so the relay Worker page + iOS reuse it), re-exported from the Electron design-system. **Safe by construction
  (the whole point):** the parser NEVER emits raw HTML (`<script>`/`<img onerror>` → literal text), DROPS image
  syntax, and the `link` AST node carries **no URL field** so a neutered link renders as a styled non-navigating
  `<span>` with no `href`/scheme ever — protecting the renderer-is-offline guarantee; it's **total** (never throws)
  and **streaming-safe** (incomplete markdown degrades to literal text, resolves on completion). A `FORMATTING`
  contract is appended **AFTER** persona+safety in `buildSystemPrompt` (chat/guided/depth-ask), the intake
  interviewer, and the dream-analysis chat (boundary still leads), with light-Markdown notes added to the
  JSON-prose calls (portrait/reflection, dream synthesis, questionnaire analysis + alignment) — prose may use it,
  **facts stay plain**. Switched all ~16 §3.4 render sites to `<Markdown>` (block) / `<Markdown inline>` (facts) —
  onboarding portrait + reflections + go-deeper chat, session messages (saved + streaming), wrap-up, dream
  synthesis + dream chat, memory insight (+ Home card), the alignment report (incl. the **relay page**) — with
  **markers stripped BEFORE rendering** (order matters) and **user input left plain**; removed redundant
  `white-space: pre-wrap` where `<Markdown>` owns layout, plus the §3.5 portrait/insight readability pass + a
  `/gallery` showcase. The offline fake Claude (both Electron + web hosts) now returns markdown so tests exercise
  real rendering (asserted substrings kept in uninterrupted text runs). Tests: parser units + DOM **security**
  units (no live `<script>`/`<img>`/`<a>`/`href`, no network) + streaming-degradation; per-surface RTL (portrait,
  session, wrap-up, insight, alignment render real `<strong>`/`<li>`, not literal `**`); E2E (session reply +
  portrait render structured). Code-reviewer **ship** (security boundary verified airtight). **Live-preview
  verified** the Sessions reply renders as a real bulleted list with bold. Gate green: typecheck, lint, format,
  **501 core + 11 relay + 598 desktop** unit; **78/79 E2E** (the 1 failure — household-AI-key sharing — is
  **pre-existing**, fails identically on clean `main`, unrelated to this change). Synced spec 34 + spec 01 §5.6
  (the `Markdown` primitive added to the catalog). **Lesson: a curated-Markdown renderer for untrusted model
  output should be safe by CONSTRUCTION, not sanitization — make the parser structurally incapable of emitting
  raw HTML, images, or an href (give the link AST node no URL field at all), so `javascript:`/`data:`/`<script>`
  have nowhere to live; and keep it a pure AST parser so the security + streaming invariants are unit-testable
  without a DOM.**
- 2026-06-23 — **Fix (a stale E2E that timed out on `main` — the auto-share UI change left it behind; on
  `fix/household-ai-key-e2e`).** The `household AI key (25): owner shares a key → a keyless device inherits it`
  E2E timed out at 30s on clean `main`. **Diagnosed, not assumed:** the auto-share feature (spec 25 §5.6) had
  merged, which **removed the manual "Share with the household" button** (an owner's key now auto-mirrors to
  `config/ai-credentials.enc` in `coreBridge.secretSet`); the test still `click`ed that deleted button, so it
  hung until the test timeout. Product behavior is correct (the coreBridge auto-share unit test passes) — only
  the E2E was stale. Fix: drop the manual-share click; after **Save key** the test now asserts the auto-share
  confirmation ("Shared with your household") directly. The vault-decrypt assertions, the device-key Clear →
  `source:'shared'`, and the no-"connect Claude" check are unchanged. Gate: lint, format, **79/79 E2E** (was
  78/79). **Lesson: when a feature removes/renames a control, grep the E2E for the old label — a `click` on a
  vanished button doesn't fail fast, it hangs to the full test timeout, reading as a mysterious flake.**
- 2026-06-23 — **Fix — PERMANENT (the release-please re-proposal loop is GONE; root cause was draft-release
  tag-timing, not the ancient footer; spec 19 amended, on `chore/fix-release-please-permanently`).** Every
  release for weeks needed 2 extra PRs (advance `bootstrap-sha` + close a spurious "release X.Y.(Z+1)" PR).
  **Diagnosed the REAL mechanism** (not the assumed "Release-As footer" story): the spurious PRs always
  re-proposed the **latest release's** commit (0.3.2→0.3.3, 0.3.3→0.3.4…), NEVER 0.1.0 — so it was **not** the
  footer. The config had **`draft: true`** (draft-until-asset), and **a draft GitHub release has no git tag
  until published**. So when release-please re-ran on the release-PR merge, the new tag didn't exist yet → it
  saw the PRIOR tag as latest → re-proposed the just-released commit as a phantom next patch. The macOS build
  published (creating the tag) ~3 min later, but the spurious PR was already open. Advancing `bootstrap-sha`
  (the scan floor) every release just MASKED it. **Permanent fix:** **`draft: false`** (release-please
  publishes immediately → tag exists when it re-checks → proposes nothing) + **drop `bootstrap-sha`** (with
  tag-detection working, release-please never scans back past the latest tag, so the ancient `Release-As:
0.1.0` footer in `36c3dff` is unreachable — the only reason the floor existed) + electron-builder
  **`publish.releaseType: release`** (upload the `.dmg` to the already-published release, not a draft).
  **Trade-off (accepted):** a release is visible for the ~3 min the build runs before its `.dmg` attaches —
  draft-until-asset is gone, but so is the loop. Synced spec 19 (amendment) + the `release.yml` comments.
  **Lesson: a draft GitHub release does NOT create its git tag until published — so any tool that detects "the
  last release" by tag (release-please) will re-propose the just-released commit when it re-runs before
  publish. Publish non-draft so the tag exists immediately; `bootstrap-sha` is a FIRST-release-only baseline
  and must be removed afterward (a kept floor overrides tag-detection and forces the re-scan). The
  spurious-PR's PROPOSED VERSION is the tell: re-proposing the latest (not 0.1.0) = a tag-timing problem, not
  the footer.** NOTE: validated end-to-end on the NEXT real release (the config-merge run itself must open NO
  release PR; the dmg-attach to a published release is proven on the next `feat`/`fix`).
- 2026-06-23 — **Fix (portrait STILL truncating on v0.3.2 — the distinct message CONFIRMED the cause; salvage
  partial JSON + bigger budget so onboarding never dead-ends; issue #19, spec 28, on
  `fix/portrait-truncation-salvage`).** The 2026-06-22 hardening shipped in v0.3.2 and the user came back with a
  NEW message: **"The portrait was cut off before it finished"** — exactly the distinct truncation message I'd
  added. So the self-diagnosing messages PAID OFF: the cause is confirmed **output truncation**, not the
  off-spec-field path. Verified the real Electron client DOES honor `extendedThinking:false` (omits `thinking`),
  so it's genuine output volume — a maximal intake (Angel: every section, 36/40 intimacy…) drove the portrait
  JSON past even 8000 tokens and it got cut off mid-`facts`. Fix: **(1) maxTokens 8000→16000** (a compliant
  portrait is ~5-6k; you only pay for tokens generated); **(2) `salvageTruncatedPortrait`** — if the full parse
  still fails, recover the `portrait` summary (it comes FIRST, almost always intact) + every COMPLETE fact object
  (a balanced-brace scan that skips the truncated trailing one), so the portrait completes instead of
  dead-ending. The "cut off" error now fires ONLY when even the summary didn't arrive. Tests: a truncated reply
  (summary + 1 complete fact + 1 cut-off fact) now SALVAGES to a valid portrait with the complete fact, dropping
  the truncated one; a reply cut off before the summary still reports "cut off". Gate green: typecheck, lint,
  format, **500 core + 11 relay + 565 desktop** unit. **Lesson: building the DISTINCT failure message in the
  prior fix is what made THIS one a 5-minute confirmed diagnosis instead of another guess — self-diagnosing
  errors are worth the extra branch. And for a structured-JSON call whose output can legitimately be large
  (driven by input richness), a strict all-or-nothing parse is the wrong contract: give generous budget AND
  salvage a partial result (the summary leads, so it survives truncation), because the user's onboarding must
  never hinge on the model fitting an exact ceiling.**
- 2026-06-22 — **Fix (onboarding portrait synthesis failed with "came back in an unexpected shape" — hardened
  BOTH plausible mechanical causes since the live call couldn't be reproduced; spec 28, on
  `fix/portrait-synthesis-robust`).** A member (Angel) finished a MAXIMAL intake (every section answered:
  36/40 intimacy, 15/16 health, 17/17 relationships…) and "See my portrait" failed every time. **Diagnosed,
  not assumed** (per §6 — and NOT a refusal): traced the code — synthesis already disables adaptive thinking
  (the §17.10 fix), so the generic error funnels TWO mechanical causes into one message: (a) **output
  truncation** — a "rich, comprehensive" summary + ~60 detailed facts on a huge intake can approach/exceed the
  6000-token ceiling → incomplete JSON → `extractJson`'s `JSON.parse` throws; (b) **one off-spec field** — a
  single non-numeric `metric` or malformed fact makes the STRICT `PortraitDraftSchema.parse` reject an
  otherwise-perfect portrait. **Could not reproduce Angel's exact call** (her answers + the key are encrypted
  on-device behind the Keychain/master-key), so rather than guess ONE cause, hardened **both**: (1) the schema
  is now **tolerant** (`.catch` on every field — only `portrait` is hard-required; a bad metric/fact/`values`
  degrades to a safe default, malformed facts drop as empty-text downstream); (2) **maxTokens 6000→8000** for
  headroom (a compliant response is ~3k); (3) the failure now **distinguishes "cut off" (truncated JSON, retry)
  from "unexpected shape"** so any residual case is self-diagnosing. Tests: an off-spec reply (non-numeric
  metric + malformed fact) now SALVAGES to a valid portrait; a truncated reply reports "cut off". Gate green:
  typecheck, lint, format, **499 core + 11 relay + 565 desktop** unit. **Lesson: a STRICT structured-JSON
  `.parse` on a model response is brittle — one off-spec optional field nukes an otherwise-perfect result;
  parse model JSON TOLERANTLY (`.catch`/salvage, require only the essential field) and give bounded JSON calls
  real output headroom. When the live call can't be reproduced (encrypted on-device), harden every
  code-identified failure surface + make the residual self-diagnosing (distinct messages) — don't ship a
  speculative single-cause guess.** (Follow-up: session/dream analysis use the same strict-`.parse` shape and
  could get the same tolerant treatment.)
- 2026-06-22 — **Process (enforce PR-only `main` client-side; on `chore/block-direct-push-to-main`).** Tried to
  add GitHub branch protection / a ruleset to enforce the new PR-only rule, but **both require GitHub Pro on a
  private repo** (HTTP 403: "Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public"). So enforcement is
  client-side: a **`pre-push` hook blocks a direct `git push origin main`** (reads the ref list on stdin;
  emergency override `git push --no-verify`). PR merges happen server-side on GitHub, so the guard only ever
  stops a local direct push — it doesn't impede the flow. Documented in CONTRIBUTING.md (+ how to add a real
  ruleset if the repo ever goes Pro or public: require the `Lint · Typecheck · Test` check + linear history + a
  PR, admin bypass). **Lesson: branch protection + rulesets are paid features for private repos — on the free
  plan, enforce PR-only with a client-side `pre-push` guard (a backstop, not a wall, since `--no-verify` and
  non-hooked clients bypass it).**
- 2026-06-22 — **Process (adopt a PR-based workflow + a real release step; durable, user-chosen; on
  `chore/dev-workflow-and-release-process`).** After a run of release-please pain (a manifest-drift loop, the
  version going backwards, duplicate draft releases, a `merge:` commitlint rejection, Node-v15 hook failures) —
  all caused by **how** we landed work, not the code — the user chose to formalize the recommended flow.
  Decisions (all "recommended" options, asked via AskUserQuestion): **(1) strict PR-based** — every change on a
  `<type>/<slug>` branch → push → PR → CI green → **squash-merge on GitHub**; `main` is **never** pushed to
  directly, **never** updated by a local merge, and you **never `git merge origin/main` into a branch** (rebase
  onto it); **(2) squash-merge** with a Conventional Commit PR title (that title drives the changelog + bump);
  **(3) offer a release after every merged slice** — _"Tag & publish vX.Y.Z now, or batch?"_; **(4) full
  implementation.** Built: rewrote CLAUDE.md §6 (cadence → branch/PR/squash/release steps) + §9 (git: squash
  titles, release-please owns versioning/tags/`CHANGELOG.md`, never hand-bump/tag, never `Release-As:`, manifest
  == latest tag + `bootstrap-sha` floor, Node ≥20 for hooks); added the **`release` skill** (safe release-please
  flow: sync + clean → health pre-flight catching manifest drift/duplicate PRs/backward versions → confirm
  version + changelog → `gh pr merge --squash` → watch the build → verify the published `.dmg` + no loop);
  updated **`ship-slice`** to push + open a PR + squash-merge + offer the release; expanded **CONTRIBUTING.md**
  (Workflow + Releases + a Node-version prereq); and added **`scripts/require-node.sh`** wired into the pre-commit
  - pre-push hooks (fails fast with "run `nvm use`" instead of a cryptic pnpm error — the v15 footgun). This very
    change was landed via the new flow (branch → PR → squash-merge) to dogfood it. **Lesson: most release pain is a
    workflow problem — keep `main` PR-only + squash-merged, let release-please own every version/tag/changelog, and
    make "release" a deliberate, pre-flighted step (the `release` skill), not an ad-hoc merge.**
- 2026-06-22 — **Release ops (v0.3.1 shipped the auto-share fix; CI Actions bumped off Node 20; release-please
  re-proposal loop fixed again — on `main`).** After merging the auto-share fix, cut **v0.3.1** (release-please
  PR #10 → tag + the macOS job published `SelfOS-0.3.1-arm64.dmg`, 108 MB). Then two CI/release housekeeping
  items: **(1)** the GitHub **Node-20 deprecation** — bumped `actions/checkout@v4→v7`, `actions/setup-node@v4→v6`,
  `pnpm/action-setup@v4→v6` in both `ci.yml` + `release.yml` (inputs unchanged; pnpm reads `packageManager` from
  package.json; CI verified green with the new actions). `googleapis/release-please-action@v4` is **left** (it
  drives the fragile release flow — a v5 major bump needs careful testing; it's force-run on Node 24 for now, a
  flagged follow-up). **[SUPERSEDED 2026-07-19 — that follow-up is DONE: `951bb1f` (#25) bumped the action to
  `@v5`, clearing the last Node-20 deprecation, and v5 (release-please 17.6.0) has since cut real releases
  including v0.39.0. The repo is on `@v5`; do not "restore" v4 on the strength of the sentence above.]**
  **(2)** Merging the v0.3.1 PR triggered a **spurious "release 0.3.2" PR (#11)** re-proposing
  the already-shipped fix — the manifest-drift loop again. Root cause this time: **`bootstrap-sha` was STALE at
  v0.3.0 (573c634)**, so release-please re-scanned from v0.3.0 each run and re-found the v0.3.1 commit. Fix:
  **advance `bootstrap-sha` to the v0.3.1 commit (e5562a6)** + close PR #11; verified the next release-please run
  opened **no** PR. **Lesson (sharpened): with this repo's `bootstrap-sha` setup, the sha MUST be advanced to each
  new release commit — it's a floor, not a "last release" marker, so leaving it at the prior release makes
  release-please re-propose the just-shipped commits as the next patch. It exists only to fence off an ancient
  `Release-As: 0.1.0` footer (commit 36c3dff); the real permanent fix is to neutralize that footer so
  `bootstrap-sha` can be dropped entirely (the manifest is already the source of truth) — a follow-up.**
- 2026-06-22 — **Fix + durable decision (AI auto-shares to the household by default — the recurring "member
  sees AI not set up on the shared vault" trap, FINALLY root-caused against the REAL vault; spec 25 §5.6, on
  `fix/ai-credentials-autoshare` off `main`, NOT merged).** A member (Angel) on the freshly-installed **released**
  app (v0.3.0) still hit "Connect AI to begin." **Diagnosed, not assumed** (per §6): (1) confirmed the spec-25 fix
  IS in v0.3.0 (`git tag --contains c639dab` → v0.3.0) — NOT a release-lag; (2) traced the code —
  `aiAvailable = resolveAiKey() && ai.enabled`, both correct, no bug; (3) **inspected the actual iCloud vault**
  (`~/.../Family/SelfOS`): `ai.enabled: true` synced ✓, owner has `anthropic.apiKey` device-local ✓, but
  **`config/ai-credentials.enc` was ABSENT** — the owner **never clicked "Share with the household"** (spec 25
  made sharing OPT-IN). So Angel correctly resolved "no key." Root cause = the opt-in itself is the trap. **Owner
  decision: sharing is the DEFAULT, with an explicit opt-out.** Built: vault setting **`ai.shareCredentials`**
  (default **true**, admin-only, in `ADMIN_ONLY_SETTING_KEYS`); **auto-share on `secretSet`** (an OWNER saving a
  Claude/OpenAI key mirrors it into the vault unless opted out — a member's own-key override stays device-local via
  the `settings.manage` guard); an idempotent **boot migration** (`ensureSharedAiCredentials` in `householdStatus`)
  so an EXISTING owner key auto-shares on next launch with no tap; the **opt-out is live** (toggle off withdraws,
  on re-shares). Removed the redundant manual "Share"/"Stop sharing" buttons (the `ai:shareDeviceKey`/`:clearSharedKey`
  ops stay — idempotent). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **497 core + 11 relay + 565 desktop** unit (+4 bridge
  auto-share/opt-out/member-stays-local; +RTL copy/no-button). **Immediate unblock (no release needed):** the owner
  clicks "Share with the household" in their CURRENT v0.3.0 app → `config/ai-credentials.enc` syncs to the member.
  This branch makes it automatic going forward (needs a release to ship). **Lesson: a "released fix that still
  fails" is a cue to inspect the REAL data, not the code — the fix was present and correct, but built an OPT-IN the
  owner never exercised; the actual vault (`ai.enabled: true` synced + `ai-credentials.enc` absent) gave the answer
  in one `ls`. When the expected behavior is "owner sets up X → household has X," make sharing the DEFAULT with an
  opt-out, not an opt-in the owner must discover.**
- 2026-06-21 — **Build (spec 33 multi-device housekeeping — FULLY BUILT, slices A–D; on
  `feat/household-ai-credentials`).** Four independent loose ends. **A** (docs) pruned spec 10's stale
  super-admin documentation so its body matches the 2026-06-14 Owner-is-full-access amendment (deleted the
  `SuperAdminFileSchema` block, the §6.4 `superadmin:*` subsection, the `config/superadmin.enc` table row +
  §7 rows; the append-only changelog stays); a doc agent did the surgery + flagged that spec 14's body still
  has live-sounding super-admin detach steps (left — it already carries a 2026-06-14 amendment note). **B**
  the OpenAI dream-image key gets a "Test connection" like Claude's: `ImageClient.verify(apiKey)` is a
  NON-generative `GET /v1/models` probe (bills nothing, never an image generation), `openaiProxy` maps the
  same NO_KEY/AUTH/RATE_LIMIT/NETWORK/API_ERROR taxonomy, bridge `openaiTest` resolves the key host-side
  (spec-25 resolver, never crosses IPC), `OpenAiTestConnectionControl` under the OpenAI key in Settings →
  Dreams. **C** iOS finally shows the conflict Banner: `isConflictCopy` moved to `@selfos/core/vault` (shared
  by both hosts); blind Swift `VaultFs.findConflicts` (`NSFileVersion.unresolvedConflictVersions` + the name
  pattern) feeds the EXISTING Banner via a new `HostParts.getConflicts` part; the web preview still returns
  `[]`. **D** sync-safety: a `vault:syncReadiness` check + a host `hasPendingDownloads` (Electron `.icloud`
  placeholder scan; iOS blind Swift) makes `HouseholdGate` show a "this folder is still syncing from iCloud"
  warning (Check again / Set up anyway) before fresh-vault Setup — advisory over the unchanged
  `createMasterKey` non-overwrite data-loss backstop. Tests: openaiProxy taxonomy + RTL; capacitor
  getConflicts/hasPendingDownloads wiring; bridge readiness; HouseholdGate warning RTL. Gate green:
  typecheck, lint, format, **462 core + 551 desktop** unit. iOS Swift is blind-written, user-verified.
  **Lesson: a non-generative auth probe (`GET /v1/models`) verifies an image key without billing an image;
  and a "still syncing" warning at the boot gate is a cheap UX layer over the real data-loss guard
  (`createMasterKey` refuses to overwrite an already-synced `recovery.enc`), not a substitute for it.**
- 2026-06-21 — **Build (spec 32 device management & key rotation — FULLY BUILT, slices A–C; on
  `feat/household-ai-credentials`).** Closes the biggest security gap: one master key on N devices with no way
  to see, revoke, or rotate it. **A** device registry (`config/devices/<id>.enc`, one file per device,
  registered on every join path + a per-launch heartbeat; key-free `deviceId` cached device-local for "this
  device"; owner-gated `devices:list`/`:rename`; `devices.manage` capability). **B** the cryptographic
  revocation core — `rotateMasterKey` re-encrypts the WHOLE vault under a fresh key + new recovery phrase,
  deletes invites, drops revoked device entries; **crash-safe** via a two-phase stage→commit journaled for
  resume (the new key sits in a **device-local temp secret**, never the synced journal, so a revoked device
  can't read it mid-rotation; Phase-1 crash discards [vault stays old-key], Phase-2 crash resumes idempotently
  to fully-new-key); `enumerateEncryptedFiles` is path-discovery over the content roots (not a per-feature
  list); owner-gated `keys:rotate` (sync-conflict pre-flight) + `keys:rotateStatus`; **resume-at-boot + §5.5
  re-key detection** in `householdStatus` (an old-key device whose key can't decrypt the access config is
  signed out → Unlock, not a corruption error). **C** the owner-only **Settings → Devices** section (the
  owner's placement choice over a standalone route) — list/rename/revoke + a deliberately-serious Revoke-&-
  re-key dialog (5 consequences) + the new-recovery-phrase panel shown once. Honest threat model (§8):
  prevents FUTURE access by a revoked device; can't retract the past; one shared key, so revoking one device
  signs out ALL (no per-member isolation — permanent non-goal). Tests (real crypto over memFileSystem): 5
  registry + 8 rotation (incl. the crash-safety + corrupt-abort, the spec's heart) + 2 bridge + 3 RTL. Gate
  green: typecheck, lint, format, **462 core + 542 desktop** unit; visual QA of the Devices panel at desktop +
  390px (fixed a narrow-card row-crush: rowMain `flex-basis: 200px` so the action buttons wrap below the device
  name instead of squeezing it to a word-per-line). E2E (cross-device revoke→re-key→sign-out) needs a local
  display. **Lesson: crash-safe whole-vault re-encryption = stage everything first (originals untouched →
  Phase-1 crash is a no-op) then swap from a complete staged set under a `committing` journal (idempotent →
  Phase-2 crash resumes); keep the new key in a DEVICE-LOCAL temp secret, never the synced journal, or a
  revoked device syncing mid-rotation reads the very key meant to lock it out.**
- 2026-06-21 — **Build + durable UX/permission decisions (on `feat/household-ai-credentials`).** Three
  owner-requested access/UX changes: **(1)** the **AI, Sessions, Questionnaires, Dreams + Relay settings
  sections are owner-only** — whole sections hidden from non-`settings.manage` users (added `adminOnly` to
  `SettingsSection`; `SettingsScreen` filters sections, not just individual settings). Non-owners see only
  Appearance / Vault / About. (Consequence: the spec-25 member key-override UI is no longer surfaced —
  members rely on the inherited shared key.) **(2)** The **dev-only `/gallery` is owner-gated** (nav link +
  route, on top of dev-only). **(3)** The header **vault/sync "checkbox" (the `SyncStatusChip`, a check-circle
  that opened the vault folder and read as an unclear checkbox) moved into the account dropdown** as an
  "Open vault folder" item; a sync conflict now shows on the account control + as a "Resolve N sync
  conflicts" item (the in-content Banner still surfaces conflicts). Deleted `SyncStatusChip`. Also finished
  **spec 25's E2E** (owner shares via UI → decrypt the vault → keyless device resolves `source:'shared'`).
  Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **449 core + 537 desktop** unit/RTL/bridge. E2E + visual QA need a
  local display (the standing Electron-E2E constraint). **Lesson: hide whole owner-only SECTIONS at the
  section level (a `SettingsSection.adminOnly` flag the screen filters on), not just per-setting — and when a
  control's icon (a check-circle) reads as an interactive checkbox, it belongs in a labelled menu item, not a
  bare titlebar chip.**
- 2026-06-21 — **Durable policy + Build (multi-device specs 25–29 group).** Audited the reported multi-device
  bug — a member installing on their own machine + selecting the shared vault saw "AI hasn't been set up"
  though the owner had set it up — and root-caused it: the **API key is a device-local secret** (00 §6.2,
  never synced) while `ai.enabled` is a **vault setting** (synced), so a joined member inherited `ai.enabled`
  but had **no key** → every AI surface (and the AI-hard-gated onboarding) locked them out. Created a 5-spec
  group ([`25` household-ai-credentials](docs/specs/25-household-ai-credentials.md) · [`30` settings trust
  boundary](docs/specs/30-settings-trust-boundary.md) · [`31` AI-required policy](docs/specs/31-ai-required.md)
  · [`32` device management & key rotation](docs/specs/32-device-management-and-key-rotation.md) ·
  [`33` housekeeping](docs/specs/33-multi-device-housekeeping.md); renumbered around a concurrent
  onboarding-redesign group at 21–24). **Built + committed on `feat/household-ai-credentials`:** **25**
  (owner shares one key, stored **encrypted under the master key** in `config/ai-credentials.enc` — the relay
  precedent — so members inherit it; device override wins; one `resolveAiKey` replaces every `secrets.get`
  AI call site; booleans-only `ai:keyStatus` replaces 11 renderer `secretHas` readiness checks; role-aware
  `SharedKeyControl`; `00` §4.1/§6.2 amended) and **26** (settings-write trust boundary enforced in the
  bridge: vault-scoped or admin-only writes require `settings.manage`, via a shared `settingsPolicy.ts` source
  anchored by a drift test). Gate green: typecheck, lint, format, **449 core + 538 desktop** unit.
  **DURABLE POLICY (the owner, explicit, 2026-06-21): "AI is required by the app and requires online, period."**
  There is **no offline / degraded / works-without-AI mode** — that reversed spec 31's original "onboarding
  offline resilience" draft (repurposed → [`31-ai-required`](docs/specs/31-ai-required.md)). When AI is
  unavailable (no key / AI off / offline) surfaces show a **clear role-aware setup/connectivity prompt**, never
  a faked experience; the onboarding hard gate (18 §3.1, portrait required) **stays** and is never relaxed; the
  Owner is exempt from the gate so they can reach setup (no chicken-and-egg). **Remaining (drafted, not built):**
  25 Playwright E2E + visual QA; 28 (device registry + revocation by whole-vault re-encryption — large, its own
  session) and 29 (super-admin doc cleanup, OpenAI test-connection, iOS conflict detection, setup sync-safety).
  **Lesson: a credential that's device-local-by-design but whose _enablement_ is vault-synced creates a
  multi-device trap — the synced half says "on" while the device half is empty; either sync both (the chosen
  fix: opt-in shared key, encrypted in the vault like the relay token) or gate readiness on the resolved
  credential, never on the synced flag alone.**
- 2026-06-17 — Fix (**release-please opened a new release PR after every merge — manifest drift loop**; spec 19,
  on `fix/release-please-manifest`). Audit (facts, not guesses — checked open PRs, releases, git tags, the
  manifest on `origin/main`, and the release-please run logs): `.release-please-manifest.json` on `main` was
  stuck at **`0.1.0`** while the real latest tag was **`v0.2.1`**. release-please trusts the manifest as "current
  version", so every push it recomputed "next after 0.1.0" → re-proposed `0.2.0` endlessly; a stale "release
  0.1.0" PR even merged AFTER 0.2.1 shipped, **resetting the manifest backward** (the self-reinforcing part). Two
  things seeded it: (a) the **`Release-As: 0.1.0` empty commit** I'd added to force the first version lingered in
  the scan range and dragged proposals back to 0.1.0; (b) **interleaving manual `git merge origin/main` + pushes
  with the release-PR merges** repeatedly carried an old manifest value forward. Fix: point the manifest at
  **`0.2.1`** (the real latest tag, published with its `.dmg`) + drop the now-spent `bootstrap-sha`; release-please
  then scanned from `v0.2.1` forward, found only chore/merge commits, and logged "No user facing commits found …
  skipping" — loop broken. Cleanup: closed the stale loop PR, deleted 3 duplicate **draft** releases (drafts carry
  no git tags, so the real v0.1.0/v0.2.0/v0.2.1 tags + published releases were untouched). The build pipeline was
  never the problem (v0.2.1 shipped its dmg fine). **Lesson: in release-please manifest mode the
  `.release-please-manifest.json` IS the source of truth for the current version and MUST match the latest git
  tag — if it drifts below the latest tag, release-please re-proposes already-shipped versions in a loop. NEVER
  use a `Release-As:` commit to set the first version (it lingers and forces backward proposals — let the manifest
  baseline + bump flags decide), remove `bootstrap-sha` after the first release, and don't hand-merge `origin/main`
  into a local branch while release PRs are also merging (it carries stale manifest values forward).**
- 2026-06-17 — Fix (**dev vs installed app share `userData` → fresh install skips setup**; on
  `fix/dev-userdata-separation`). User noticed the **built** app booted straight into their dev vault instead of
  first-run setup. Cause (diagnosed): the vault pointer + master key + settings live device-local in Electron's
  `userData`, whose path derives from the app **name**; `index.ts` called `app.setName('SelfOS')`
  unconditionally and electron-builder's `productName` is also `SelfOS`, so dev and the packaged app resolved to
  the **same** `~/Library/Application Support/SelfOS` — the packaged app read the dev session's device state and
  skipped setup. (Real end-users are unaffected — no dev env writes there.) Fix:
  `app.setName(app.isPackaged ? 'SelfOS' : 'SelfOS Dev')` so a dev run gets its own `userData`, independent of
  the installed app. One-line Electron-runtime change (no meaningful unit test). **Note:** after this a dev run
  uses `SelfOS Dev` (re-links the vault once — data is safe); the packaged app keeps `SelfOS`, so to see its true
  first-run, clear the leftover `~/Library/Application Support/SelfOS` once. **Lesson: Electron `userData` is
  keyed by the app NAME — if dev and the packaged build share a name they share device state (vault pointer,
  master key), so a fresh install on a dev machine silently inherits the dev vault; gate the name on
  `app.isPackaged`.**
- 2026-06-17 — Fix (**relay Worker bundle missing in the packaged macOS app**; spec 19 §5/§13, on
  `fix/relay-bundle-packaging`). User hit "The relay Worker bundle is missing. Build it first: pnpm --filter
  @selfos/relay build" connecting the Cloudflare relay in the **built** app. Root cause (diagnosed, not
  assumed): the release workflow only ran `pnpm --filter @selfos/desktop build` so `apps/relay/dist/worker.js`
  was **never built** in CI; electron-builder's `files` packaged only `out/**` + `package.json` (the relay dist
  lives at `apps/relay/dist`, outside `out/`); and `loadRelayBundle`'s candidate paths assumed the repo layout,
  which doesn't exist inside a packaged `.app`. Fix (3 parts): (1) **build the relay in CI** — a
  `pnpm --filter @selfos/relay build` step in `release.yml` before packaging (+ the `release:build` script
  builds it first for local parity); (2) **package it** — electron-builder `extraResources` copies
  `../relay/dist` → `Contents/Resources/relay`; (3) **find it at runtime** — `loadRelayBundle` checks
  `process.resourcesPath/relay` as the highest-priority candidate (dev still falls through to the
  workspace/repo-relative candidates). Also ignore the `release/` electron-builder output in eslint + prettier,
  and `CHANGELOG.md` in prettier (release-please owns it — otherwise format:check fights the generated file).
  **Verified end-to-end** by running `electron-builder --mac --dir` and confirming `worker.js` (479 KB) +
  `meta.json` land in `SelfOS.app/Contents/Resources/relay/`. Code-reviewer **ship**. Gate green: typecheck
  (node + web), lint, format, **441 core + 11 relay + 532 desktop** unit (+1 relayBundle resourcesPath test).
  Rolls into the pending `0.2.0` release. **Lesson: an electron-builder app only ships what's in `files` /
  `extraResources` — a separately-built sibling-package artifact (the relay Worker `worker.js`) must be built
  in CI _before_ packaging AND copied in via `extraResources`, then located at runtime via
  `process.resourcesPath`, never a repo-relative path that exists only in the dev tree.**
- 2026-06-17 — Build (**onboarding: kids & pets conditional rosters — a new shared `roster` answer type; spec 18
  §14.6/§14.9**, landed on `main` via a worktree). User: "if they mark they have kids, a conditional field should
  option to select how many, the names and genders. Same with pets." **Asked first** (4 forks): trigger = when
  they have kids (have-young/grown-kids; the liveWith→Children auto-fill flows in too); per child = **name +
  gender + age**; per pet = **name + species + gender**; storage = **portrait/context only** (no Person field).
  Built a generic **`roster` `AnswerType`** — `Question.roster` declares the per-row columns
  (`{key,label,type:'text'|'select',options?,placeholder?}`), value is `Record<string,string>[]`. Rendered by
  `@selfos/answering` as **stacked per-row cards** (fields stack vertically, so a roster row can NEVER overflow
  horizontally — the dateRow lesson taken further). Two rosters in **Your life now**: `children` (branched on the
  Children single-choice) + `petsDetail` (branched on a pet in the "Any pets?" multi, via array-includes
  branching). `answerToString` now formats object-row arrays ("Emma, Girl, 7; Liam, Boy, 4") — also fixed a latent
  dateList "[object Object]" in the portrait. Widened `IntakeAnswerValue` + `Answer.value` + added
  `RosterColumnSchema`. Roster **text** columns also carry placeholders (the placeholder guard now covers them).
  Gate green (worktree): typecheck, lint, format, **438 core + 11 relay + 514 desktop** unit (+roster isAnswered/
  format, +roster-persists-no-PersonField-and-feeds-portrait, +roster RTL add/fill/remove), **73 E2E** (the
  life-now test now adds a child [name/gender/age] + reveals the pets roster, with a roster no-overflow geometry
  check). Visual QA caveat: the web preview gates the onboarding form behind `aiAvailable`, so the roster is
  verified by the E2E (real Chromium: reveal + fill + geometry) + RTL rather than a screenshot; the stacked-card
  layout is overflow-safe by construction. On `feat/kids-pets-roster` off `main`, merged. **Lesson: a generic
  `roster` answer type (configurable columns) is the clean way to capture repeatable structured sub-data (kids,
  pets) without per-feature controls; render rows as STACKED cards so they're overflow-safe at any width, and
  teach `answerToString` to format object-row arrays or the portrait gets "[object Object]".**
- 2026-06-17 — Fix + feedback (**onboarding: ALL free-text questions must have placeholders + drop a redundant
  decisionStyle option; spec 18 §14.6**, landed on `main` via a worktree). User (frustrated, repeat): "im STILL
  seeing text fields with no placeholders, THEY MUST ALL HAVE PLACEHOLDERS." Audited the catalog — **57** of 211
  shortText/longText questions had only `(id, prompt)` and no placeholder; added a meaningful example/help
  placeholder to **every one** (e.g. occupation → "e.g. nurse, teacher, software engineer"; proudOf → "A moment,
  a relationship, something you built…"). **Added a unit guard** (`intakeCatalog.test.ts`): every shortText/
  longText question MUST have a non-empty `placeholder` — so this can't silently regress (the "should've caught
  it in testing" lesson, made a test). Also: per the user, removed **"The data"** from `decisionStyle` ("You make
  big decisions mostly with your…") — it overlapped "Head" (both the analytical pole); now a clean Head/Heart/Gut.
  **Durable rule: every intake free-text question carries a placeholder (enforced by the catalog test).** Gate
  green (worktree): typecheck, lint, format, 435 core + 11 relay + 513 desktop unit (+the placeholder guard), 73
  E2E (1 unrelated spec-20 memory test flaked, passed in isolation). On `fix/placeholders-decisionstyle` off
  `main`, merged. (The kids/pets structured-roster request is a separate slice — asked the user first.)
- 2026-06-17 — Fix + build (**two onboarding-form follow-ups from a user screenshot; spec 18 §14.6**, landed on
  `main` via worktrees while a concurrent agent held the shared tree). **(1) Important-dates row was visually
  broken** (user flagged: label collapsed to nothing, the × remove button shoved outside the card). Cause: the
  shared `.input { width: 100% }` beat the date input's `flex: 0 0 auto`, so the date input ate the whole row.
  Fix: `.dateRow input[type='date'] { width: auto; min-width: 0 }` so it sizes to content and the label fills.
  Added an **E2E geometry guard** (label box wider than the date box + no page overflow) and **proved it FAILS on
  the old CSS, passes on the fix** — the test that should have caught it. **(2) "Your cultural or ethnic
  background"** changed from a free-text field to a **multi-select** (White/European, Black/African,
  Hispanic/Latino, East/South/Southeast Asian, MENA, Indigenous, Pacific Islander, Mixed, Other write-in,
  Prefer-not-to-say) → the picks join into the string `ethnicity` field via `fillPersonFields` (a multi → joined
  string, like a contact's free text; NOT a list). **Asked first** (single vs multi → user chose multi for mixed
  heritage). Gate green (in the worktree): typecheck, lint, format, unit (+ethnicity-joins-to-string in the
  field-fill test), E2E (+ ethnicity multi-pick in the onboarding field-fill test → decrypts the vault, asserts
  the joined string). **Process lesson (recurred): a concurrent agent switched the SHARED working tree onto their
  branch with uncommitted WIP — committing there would land my work on their branch + risk staging their files.
  The fix is a `git worktree add -b <branch> /tmp/x main` (pnpm install in the worktree is ~4s on a warm store),
  do + gate + commit + merge entirely in the isolated worktree, then revert my stray edits in the shared tree so
  the agent's branch stays clean. Don't `git checkout main` in the shared tree — it would drag the agent's
  uncommitted WIP onto main.**
- 2026-06-17 — Fix (**no "Finish" button in the sent/locked questionnaire preview; 08 §17.14f**; on
  `fix/questionnaire-delete-draft-sentstate-relay`, **merged to `main`** at the user's explicit instruction
  "commit all changes to main"). User: the read-only preview of a sent questionnaire still showed the
  test-on-yourself "Finish" button + "Answer the N required questions to finish" — confusing, since a sent
  questionnaire is shown for reference only. `QuestionnairePreview` gains a `readOnly` prop that drops the
  Finish button + required-validation and shortens the intro banner to "This is exactly what your recipient
  sees."; the builder passes `readOnly` from the **locked (sent)** branch only — the **unsent** Preview mode
  keeps the real dry-run Finish. Verified live in the web preview (sent questionnaire → no Finish). Gate green:
  typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **437 core + 11 relay + 530 desktop** unit (+1 lock-view assert
  for no-Finish), **77 E2E**. Synced 08 §17.14f. **This is the close-out of the questionnaire send-lifecycle
  branch — now merged to `main`.**
- 2026-06-17 — Fix (**compatibility variant pronoun safety (options rewritten with gender) + a sleek Share
  card; 08 §17.14e**; on `fix/questionnaire-delete-draft-sentstate-relay`, NOT merged). User: a compat
  question for HIM about his FEMALE partner showed options with "him" (answers read as if she were
  answering). Root cause: `generateVariant` only rewrote PROMPTS, never OPTIONS, and was never told either
  participant's gender. Fix: `generateVariant` now takes `forGender`/`aboutGender` (from `Person.gender`,
  passed at all 3 compat call sites); the prompt names each participant with pronouns ("Ben (he/him)",
  "Angel (she/her)"), forbids the wrong-gender pronoun for the other person, and rewrites each prompt **AND
  each option** — the model returns `[{prompt, options}]`; options are applied only when the count is
  preserved (else canonical kept — alignment safety). New `pronounHint` (female→she/her, male→he/him,
  non-binary→they/them, else name). The offline fakes + all 3 fake-Claude hosts updated to the object shape.
  Also: the sent-preview **Share card** redesigned (accent icon tile + heading + explainer + "Get the link",
  link/PIN/Refresh/delivery inside) instead of a loose banner+button. Gate: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib),
  lint, format, **437 core + 11 relay + 530 desktop** unit (+ option-rewrite/no-wrong-pronoun, count-mismatch
  keeps canonical, gender-plumbing message), **77 E2E**; share card verified live (screenshots).
  **Lesson: personalizing a compatibility question means BOTH the prompt AND the options — gendered pronouns
  live in the options, so rewriting only the prompt leaves answers in the wrong person's voice; pass both
  participants' genders explicitly and rewrite options too. NOTE (relay-link staleness, carried from §17.14c/d):
  the user's EXISTING sends predate `pinWrapped`, so the FIRST "Get the link" on an old send mints once (the
  PIN was unrecoverable), then it's stable; new sends are stable from the first view.**
- 2026-06-17 — Fix (**"Share link" re-shows the EXISTING link (stable) + a manual Refresh to regenerate; 08
  §17.14d**; on `fix/questionnaire-delete-draft-sentstate-relay`, NOT merged). User: Share link shouldn't
  regenerate a fresh link+PIN on every click — it should re-show the existing one (to copy/email), with a
  Refresh next to the Secure link to regenerate manually. Required STORING the PIN (it was hash-only): added
  **`Assignment.relay.pinWrapped`** (PIN encrypted under the master key; the relay still only holds `pinHash`),
  set in `mintRelay`; new core **`readRelayLink`** reconstructs the existing link (token + wrapped content key)
  - PIN with no mint/relay call. **`questionnaires:shareLink` gains `regenerate?`** — default re-shows the
    existing (mints only if the send predates `pinWrapped`); `regenerate:true` (the manual **Refresh**) mints
    fresh + revokes old. `RelayLinkDelivery` got a **Refresh** button beside the Secure link (only on the share
    view, not the already-fresh send-time confirmation); the "we don't keep the PIN, share it now" copy →
    "you can find this link again from Share a link" everywhere. **VERIFIED LIVE** (bridge: 2× Share link →
    identical link+PIN; Refresh → different; screenshot of Refresh-beside-link). Gate: typecheck (node +
    web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **434 core + 11 relay + 530 desktop** unit, **77 E2E**. Synced 08 §17.14d.
    **Lesson: "re-share" ≠ "regenerate" — re-showing a stable artifact must READ stored material (store the PIN
    encrypted), not re-mint; make regenerate an explicit action.**
- 2026-06-17 — Fix (**THE relay-link root cause: stale deployed Worker (404) + bump version + link reachable
  after sending; 08 §17.14c**; on `fix/questionnaire-delete-draft-sentstate-relay`, NOT merged). The §17.14b
  "loud failure" surfaced the actual bug: a real-Cloudflare **404 on `POST /api/admin/mailbox`** — the user's
  **deployed Worker was stale** (older code under the same `relayVersion '1'` label), missing the upload route.
  The current `dist/worker.js` HAS the route, but nothing prompted a redeploy because
  `updateAvailable = config.relayVersion !== currentVersion` and BOTH were '1'. Fix: **bump RELAY_VERSION 1→2**
  (build.mjs + relayBundle.ts, kept in sync) + rebuild the bundle → an already-deployed v1 relay now shows the
  **"Update relay"** button (one click re-uploads the current Worker, reusing KV + secret → fixes the 404, no
  re-provision). **Standing rule: bump RELAY_VERSION on EVERY Worker route/behaviour change**, or an old deploy
  reads as current + silently 404s new routes. **Link reachable after sending** (user: "see it still after sent
  at the top of preview + under the 3 dots"): new **`questionnaires:shareLink`** IPC re-mints the latest open
  send's RECIPIENT link (factored with reshare into one `reshareLink` helper), surfaced as a **"Share a link"**
  button at the **top of the sent (locked) preview** + a **"Share link"** kebab item (above Delete, sent-only)
  that opens + auto-fetches it → the shared `RelayLinkDelivery` (link + PIN + message + Email/Text/Copy).
  **VERIFIED LIVE with screenshots** (sent compat → Share a link → Secure link `…workers.dev/q/…` + PIN +
  prefilled message + Email/Text/Copy; kebab shows "Share link"). Gate: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint,
  format, **434 core + 11 relay + 530 desktop** unit (+ shareLink coreBridge, 2 Share RTL), **77 E2E**. Synced
  08 §17.14c. **Lesson: a deploy-version constant that doesn't bump when the deployed CODE changes is a
  silent-staleness trap — the "update available" prompt never fires, so the user's stale Worker keeps 404ing
  new routes; bump it on every change. The §17.14b loud-failure change is what made this diagnosable at all.**
- 2026-06-17 — Fix (**relay-mint failures made LOUD + sent questionnaires LOCKED; 08 §17.14b**; on
  `fix/questionnaire-delete-draft-sentstate-relay`, NOT merged). User STILL saw no link on a compat household
  send **with a relay connected** — root cause: both `assignmentsCreate` AND `assignmentsCreateCompatibility`
  **silently swallowed** a `putMailbox` failure in a `catch` and returned the Inbox-only result, so a
  connected-but-unreachable/stale relay looked like "the feature is broken." Both result types gain
  **`linkError?`**; a mint failure now surfaces ("We couldn't create the link ({reason}) — open Results →
  Resend") distinct from the no-relay hint; a coreBridge test forces the relay unreachable and asserts
  `linkError` (proven). **Asked first** the 2 forks: relay-status (user: connected → it's a real bug; this
  surfacing is the fix + diagnosis) and the lock behavior. **Lock (user: "once sent it should just show the
  preview"):** a SENT questionnaire opens **read-only Preview** (no Edit, frozen questions, "use Duplicate to
  change it" notice) + a footer of Send-again / Duplicate / Delete / Close; **Send again is disabled until a
  re-send cooldown** (`RESEND_COOLDOWN_DAYS=7`) with a notice, and the list row shows **"Ready to re-send"** once
  due. **Full delivery E2E matrix** (the user's "test ALL types" demand → new §7 DoD rule): one-person household
  (relay → link + Email/Text; no relay → connect-a-relay hint, no link), one-person external, compat household,
  compat external — assert the link + Email/Text/Copy delivery render (or the hint). **Verified LIVE** (preview:
  compat household with a relay → link + editable message + Email/Text; sent questionnaire → locked read-only,
  Send-again disabled "Ask again in 7 days", Duplicate/Delete, no Edit). Gate green: typecheck (node +
  web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **526 desktop + 434 core + 11 relay** unit (+ linkError-surfaced, lock view, cooldown,
  delivery-matrix), **77 E2E** (+2 delivery matrix; the re-asks trend E2E now seeds its 2nd send via the bridge,
  since the in-UI re-send is cooldown-gated). Synced 08 §17.14b. **NEW HARD RULE (§7 DoD): a SENDING/DELIVERY
  change is verified across EVERY type × recipient × relay-state — one-person AND compatibility, household AND
  external, relay AND none — never one path; a `catch` that falls back to a "still works" state MUST record WHY
  (surface the error), because a silent fallback on a connected relay is indistinguishable from broken.** **Lesson:
  the "unified delivery" feature had a third hidden gap beyond the two send paths — the `catch` that hid the
  real-relay failure; the user's bug was the swallowed error, not a logic bug, and only surfacing it (+ testing
  the failure path) makes it diagnoseable.**
- 2026-06-17 — Build (**Compatibility unified delivery + re-publish/resend — the COMPAT path the prior fix never
  touched; 08 §17.14a**; on `fix/questionnaire-delete-draft-sentstate-relay`, NOT merged). The user (furious) was
  testing a **compatibility** send (you + Angel) — a separate path from the standard household send fixed in
  §17.14 — and it minted **no link**, appended the "Sent" confirmation **below** the still-visible editor + Send
  button (tall empty void), and offered no re-share. Root cause: "unified delivery" (§17.13) was only wired into
  `assignmentsCreate`, never `assignmentsCreateCompatibility`. **Asked first** the 3 forks (household compat gets
  the SAME link + email/SMS as external; sending REPLACES the editor; re-publish RE-MINTS a fresh link+PIN since
  the PIN is never stored). Built: **(1)** household `assignmentsCreateCompatibility` now `attachRelayLink`s the
  RECIPIENT's variant (sender answers their own in-app — no self link) when sendExternal + relay connected,
  returning `{link,pin}`; `CompatibilityMember += relayLinked/isSelf`. **(2)** extracted **`RelayLinkDelivery`**
  (link + PIN + editable message from the `defaultMessages` Settings templates + editable email/phone +
  Email/Text/Copy/Share) — now used by the external, standard-household, compat, AND Results surfaces, so a
  household partner finally gets the prefilled email/SMS, not just a copy-link row. **(3)** the builder renders the
  send→delivery step **instead of** the editor while `sendId` is set (kills the lingering Send + empty void).
  **(4)** new **`assignments:reshare`** mints a fresh link+PIN for an open send (revokes the old), surfaced as
  Results **"Resend link"** / **"Create a link"** + a compat group drain. **VERIFIED LIVE** in the web preview
  (compat household send → link + editable message + Email/Text; Results drain + resend). Gate: typecheck (node +
  web/DOM-lib), lint, format, unit (+coreBridge compat-household-mints-recipient-link + reshare-fresh + self-member
  refused; +Results RTL standard reshare + compat drain/resend), E2E (+1 walking a household compat send through
  the UI → link + Email/Text delivery → Results drain + resend; +decrypt asserts the compat assignment carries
  relay material). Synced 08 §17.14a. **Lesson: a "unified" feature with TWO entry paths
  (`assignmentsCreate` AND `assignmentsCreateCompatibility`) is only half-done if you wire one — the user tests the
  path you didn't; verify the ACTUAL path they're on (compatibility), LIVE, before claiming a fix.**
- 2026-06-17 — Build (**Questionnaire send-lifecycle fixes — 4 user-reported gaps the passing tests missed; 08
  §17.14**; on `fix/questionnaire-delete-draft-sentstate-relay`, NOT merged). The user hit four lifecycle gaps
  and (rightly) demanded the rules change so "glaringly obvious" things stop slipping past green suites. **Asked
  first** the 3 UX forks: draft saving = **save anytime, validate at send**; delete = **list row + builder**;
  sent-state = **list badge + builder header**. Built: **(#3, the serious one)** relay affordances in
  `QuestionnaireResults` now gate on a new **`SendResult.relayLinked`** (`Boolean(assignment.relay)`), NOT
  `channel === 'relay'` — a household send is `channel:'inApp'` even with a minted link (§17.13), so the **"Check
  for responses" drain button never rendered** and a relay response was unretrievable; a coreBridge test that
  drained the link by calling the bridge **directly** had stayed green while the BUTTON was missing. **(#4)** new
  sender-scoped **`questionnaires:sendStates`** IPC → a **"Sent · <date>"** chip on the list row + the builder
  header ("Sent <date> (N times)"); sending refreshes the store so it shows on return. **(#1)** a list-row kebab
  (`QuestionnaireRowMenu`) → Delete → inline confirm (bridge re-enforces Owner-any-stage / creator-own-unsent).
  **(#2)** `canSave` needs only a title; `input()` drops blank-prompt drafts so a half-built questionnaire
  persists; **Send still validates** completeness. **Verified the COMPLETE flow live** (web preview: list chips +
  kebab confirm + the household-send drain button + "Sent (2 times)" header). Gate green: typecheck (node +
  web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **420 core + 520 desktop + 11 relay** unit, **74 E2E** (a new test walks the whole
  flow through the UI: connect relay → draft-save → send → Sent badge → Results drain button → list-row delete).
  Synced 08 §17.14. **NEW HARD RULE (CLAUDE.md §7 DoD): drive the COMPLETE user-facing flow through the actual
  rendered UI — a bridge/integration test proves the backend, NOT that the button that calls it exists; a
  household relay drain was bridge-tested-green while the UI gated the button on the wrong condition so it never
  showed. Also surface state where the user looks next (a Sent badge), not a form that looks untouched.** **Lesson
  (the §17.13 root cause): a feature flag/affordance must key off what actually enables it (relay material
  present), not a sibling display value (the channel) — gating on `channel === 'relay'` silently disabled the
  whole link-retrieval path for the new household-link case.**

  [20-memory-dashboard](docs/specs/20-memory-dashboard.md) §3/§8/§9, on `feat/memory-dashboard` **worktree**,
  NOT merged). Rebuilt `routes/memory/Memory.tsx` into the living dashboard: header (search + Refresh memory +
  filters source/subject/confidence/flagged), a "Needs your review" drafts section, a collapsible Trends section
  (reuses `LineChart`), the person's own insights grouped by **life-area**, and a read-only "About people you
  relate to" section. New `InsightCard.tsx` — own = interactive (per-fact flag-inaccurate toggle + `ShareToggle`,
  confidence chip + rationale, provenance link that **deep-links to the source**, sensitive tag, edit/approve/
  delete, crisis-lead); related = read-only. New **`ConfidenceChip`** primitive (text + non-colour-only dots +
  rationale → exported, `/gallery`, tested). `provenance.ts` + `trends.ts` helpers; wired `Sessions`/`Dreams` to
  open the referenced item from router state. **Code-reviewer fix-first (2 should-fixes):** (a) the Dreams

  profile-suggestion precedent), and the full AI reconcile (confidence/rationale/merge) runs **only** on a manual

  folding categories into the one existing analysis call (the §18 profile-suggestion precedent) over a second
  per-analysis AI call; and flag-as-inaccurate must suppress the insight SUMMARY too on a whole-insight flag, not
  just the facts, or the corrected claim still reaches the coach.** **NEXT: slice 3** (the dashboard UI).
- 2026-06-16 — Build (**Memory dashboard — SLICE 1: the cross-user privacy fix; SPEC 20 Approved**;
  [20-memory-dashboard](docs/specs/20-memory-dashboard.md) §1.1/§5.1/§6, on `feat/memory-dashboard` off `main`
  **in an isolated git worktree**, NOT merged). Closed a **serious live leak**: `coreBridge.insightsList` called
  `listAllInsights` (EVERY household subject) gated only on `questionnaires.viewResults` (a default Member cap)
  and never scoped to the active person — so **any signed-in member saw every member's** onboarding portraits +
  session/dream/questionnaire insights; plus `useInsightStore` was missing from the AppShell per-person reset
  (insights lingered across a switch). Fix: new **`memory.own`** capability (Member ON); `insightsList` rewritten
  to gate on `memory.own` + return the active person's **OWN** insights (full — incl. their own restricted facts,
  their own data) **+** their relationships' **shareable, non-restricted** facts via a new core
  **`listRelatedShareableInsights`** (mirrors the `summarizeForContext` boundary; **never `listAllInsights`** for
  the dashboard). `insights:approve`/`update`/`delete` locked to `memory.own` + `subjectPersonId ===
activePersonId`. Added a store `reset()` + wired `useInsightStore` into the AppShell per-person reset; re-pointed
  the Memory nav + Home MemoryCard gating to `memory.own`. The current questionnaire-era Memory surface shows only
  the person's **own** insights for now (related display lands with the §5.3 dashboard, slice 3) — no half-built
  related cards / dead controls (§12). **Code-reviewer fix-first caught a real residual leak (BLOCKER, fixed):**
  `listRelatedShareableInsights` first spread the whole Insight, so a related person's private `metrics`,
  `crisisFlag` (the Memory UI **renders** it as a distress banner), precise `provenance` (`intakeSection`/
  `conversationId`/`dreamId`), and a fact's `shareableWith` (who-ELSE-has-it) crossed the IPC seam — now it
  projects an **explicit minimal shape** (only the shareable fact text + a stripped `{at}` provenance), matching
  `summarizeForContext` exactly; + a unit test asserting the scrub, + the `memory.own` capability test, + the
  stale "only an owner sees it here" copy reconciled. Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format,
  **421 core + 500 desktop** unit (+ `listRelatedShareableInsights` [4: shareable-only/summary-stripped/scrub/
  targeting], `memory.own` caps [2], a Memory own-only-scope RTL, the per-person bridge regression, updated the
  contextOnly/intake/gating bridge tests off the old "owner-sees-all" assumption), **70 E2E** (+1 HARD-GATE
  cross-user guard: member A's Memory shows only A's portrait, B's is absent + **decrypt** proves B's insight
  exists-but-withheld, switching to B flips the view). **Follow-up flagged (NOT done):** `redactRestrictedFacts` +
  the `intake.readRestricted` capability are now dead (their only consumer was the removed leak path) — a separate
  cleanup. **NEXT: slice 2** (living insights engine — schema + `reconcileInsights` + flag-as-inaccurate + the
  producer hooks) → **slice 3** (the dashboard UI). **Lesson: a "structured sibling" of a context-builder must
  project an EXPLICIT minimal shape, never spread the whole record — `summarizeForContext` emits only a related
  person's shareable fact TEXT, so the Memory equivalent leaks `metrics`/`crisisFlag`/`provenance`/`shareableWith`
  if it spreads; the bridge is the trust boundary, so "the UI doesn't render it yet" is no defense.**
- 2026-06-16 — Fix (**unified-relay link was invisible without a connected relay**; user: "I'm not seeing
  anything in the UI for a relay link"). **Diagnosed against the live app (not assumed):** reproduced in the web
  preview — `assignmentsCreate` returns `{ assignment }` (no link) when **no relay is connected**, and
  `{ assignment, link, pin }` (the panel shows the link + PIN, screenshot-verified) when one **is**. So the code
  was correct — a link literally requires a relay (a server) — but the feature was **silently invisible** with
  no relay: the panel just said "it's in their Inbox", no hint a link was possible or how to enable it. The
  happy-path E2E connected a relay first, so it never covered the **common real no-relay state** the user hit.
  Fix: the send panel reads `relayStatus()` and, when **not connected**, shows a hint before AND after sending —
  admin → "connect a relay in Settings → Relay to also give them a link"; member → "ask an admin." +RTL for the
  no-relay hint; **new §7 DoD rule: test a feature with its PREREQUISITE absent (the common real state), not just
  the happy path — assert the graceful fallback AND that the UI says how to enable it (never silently
  invisible).** Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **417 core + 501 desktop + 11 relay**
  unit. Synced 08 §17.13. On `feat/questionnaire-unified-relay` off `main`. **Lesson: an offline fake / a
  happy-path E2E that SETS UP the prerequisite hides what the user actually experiences without it — reproduce
  the no-prerequisite path against the live app.**
- 2026-06-16 — Build (**unified questionnaire delivery — a household send ALSO mints a relay link; SPEC 08
  §17.13 BUILT** on `feat/questionnaire-unified-relay` off `main`, NOT merged). The 6th of the user's reported
  issues (the first 5 merged separately): the same answering workflow for internal + external, so a household
  recipient can answer in their **Inbox** OR via a **link** anywhere — whichever they reach first. **Decision
  (user-chosen): a link for every send + keep the Inbox; first-submission wins; Inbox-only fallback when no
  relay is connected.** **Core:** extracted a shared `mintRelay` helper from `createRelaySend` and added
  **`attachRelayLink`** (mints relay material for an existing in-app send + uploads the mailbox); `drainRelaySend`
  now **skips an already-submitted/declined send** (first-wins guard). **Bridge:** `assignmentsCreate` returns
  **`InAppSendResult { assignment, link?, pin? }`** — it mints a link ONLY when the sender can `sendExternal`
  AND a relay is connected (else Inbox-only, the graceful no-Cloudflare fallback; the send stays `channel:
'inApp'`); an in-app submit/decline best-effort **revokes the mailbox** (closes the link); the drain filter now
  covers **any** send with relay material, not just `channel: 'relay'`. **UI:** the send panel surfaces the link
  - PIN (copy rows). **Tests:** core (attach round-trip + first-wins drain), coreBridge integration (household
    send → in Inbox AND link-answerable → drains in; in-app submit → unlock 404), send-panel RTL, + a Playwright
    E2E (connect relay → household send → panel shows link/PIN → decrypt: in-app assignment carries relay
    material). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **417 core + 500 desktop + 11 relay**
    unit, **70 E2E**; visual QA of the send panel. **Lesson: the relay-minting is reusable — one `mintRelay` helper
    serves both an external send and a household link; the link is an ADDITIONAL surface on an in-app send (not a
    channel change), and first-wins is two cheap guards (revoke-the-mailbox on in-app submit + skip-if-submitted
    on drain), not a distributed transaction.** **All 6 user-reported questionnaire issues are now addressed.**
- 2026-06-16 — Fixes (**questionnaire answering UI/UX + compatibility variant bug**, on
  `fix/questionnaire-answering-and-relay` off the merged `main`; user-reported after testing). Six issues; the
  plan was approved before coding (no backward-compat needed). **Slice 1 (answering renderer, `@selfos/answering`):**
  (a) long question prompts were **bisected by the card border** — a `<fieldset>`/`<legend>` renders the legend
  ON the border; replaced with a plain card + a `<p>` heading (each control keeps its own aria-label, so no
  double-label collision). (b) **Scale questions render as a slider** — `rating` now renders the `SliderControl`
  (labelled 1…N), no number-button grids; a **required** scale is NOT auto-seeded (stays unanswered until moved,
  so a required intimacy rating can't silently default to the midpoint). (c) **Choice options are left-aligned,
  full-width cards** (single/multi/this-or-that) that stack — long option text reads cleanly; multi options are
  now `role=checkbox` (was an implicit button). Verified live at desktop + 390px. **Slice 2 (builder layout):**
  the builder was cramped beside a tall mostly-empty master list with an orphaned empty band below — now opening
  a questionnaire shows a **centered full-width focused editor** (the list hides, returns via the "← Questionnaires"
  back link, at every width). E2E updated for the focus flow (reopen via the list after going back; Suggested/New
  reached from the list). **Slice 3 (THE serious bug — compatibility variants):** a compatibility recipient was
  asked questions **about themselves instead of the other participant** (Angel, answering Ben's send, saw "…with
  Angel"). `generateVariant` only personalized tone and kept the same meaning; it now takes an explicit
  **`aboutName`** (the other participant) + a perspective instruction, and the bridge passes the right pairing —
  the sender's variant is **about the recipient**, the recipient's (household OR external) is **about the sender**.
  Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **415 core + 498 desktop + 11 relay** unit, **69 E2E**.
  **Lesson (now a §7 DoD item): for personalized/generated content, assert the CONTENT is correct for the viewer
  — not just that the screen renders. A green flow + the offline fake's canned output hid a recipient being asked
  about themselves; the fakes now echo the `aboutName` and the coreBridge integration test + a Playwright E2E
  decrypt each participant's frozen variant and assert it names the OTHER person, not themselves.** **NEXT
  (slice 4): unify the relay so a household recipient can answer in the Inbox OR via a link.**
- 2026-06-16 — Fix + feedback (**People editor: actually REMOVE the duplicated profile questions** — user was
  angry the About tab still showed all the fields after the prior "slim" pass; spec 18 §14.6, on
  `feat/people-editor-cleanup`, NOT merged). The prior slice made onboarding _cover_ the People fields but left
  them sitting in the People → About tab — the user (correctly) called that out as not the cleanup they asked
  for. **Asked first** (2 forks — the genuine ambiguity is **contacts**: the People editor edits both Subjects
  [who onboard] and non-Subject contacts [who never do, so the fields are their only input]): user chose **(1)**
  "Remove it, keep dream-image fields for contacts" + **(2)** "dreams use onboarding data now." Result:
  - a **Subject** has **NO About tab** (and Profile loses Pronouns + Birthday) — a note says their profile comes
    from onboarding;
  - a **non-Subject contact** keeps an About tab with **only** the visual/dream-image fields (gender, appearance,
    ethnicity) + Notes; occupation/relationship status/children/living situation/interests/location/important
    dates/pronouns/birthday + the deep self fields are gone.
    The `about` tab is conditionally absent (`!isSubject`); a `useEffect` falls back to Profile if a person is
    flipped to Subject while About is open. **Data-safety:** `save()` **carries every non-edited field through from
    the loaded person** (incl. now-also email/phone) since `upsertPerson` rebuilds from the input — removing the UI
    never wipes onboarding-collected data; `VISIBLE_FIELD_KEYS` (bulk Share/Lock scope) narrowed to
    gender/appearanceDescription/ethnicity/notes so hidden fields keep their lock state. Deleted the
    `ImportantDatesEditor` + its CSS; dropped now-unused imports. Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint,
    format, **498 desktop** unit (reworked the 5 People About RTL tests: Subject hides About + carries fields
    through; contact keeps only the 3 visual fields, the rest absent; single-lock + Lock-all + Share-all on the
    reduced visible set), **69 E2E** (the People + shareability tests now use a contact for the About tab and the
    3 visual fields; the responsive sweep checks a Subject's Notes tab since About is gone). **Visual QA in the web
    preview** (People needs no AI, unlike onboarding): a Subject shows Profile·Notes·Relationships·Access (no
    About) + the onboarding note; a contact's About shows only Gender/Appearance/Ethnicity + Share-all/Lock-all,
    no console errors. **Lesson: "clean up the People page" meant REMOVE the duplicated questions from the editor,
    not make onboarding mirror them — when one surface "owns" data, the other should stop showing it; the only
    nuance is a second audience (contacts) that has no other input, so gate the removal on the audience
    (`isSubject`) and carry every removed field through on save so nothing is wiped.**

- 2026-06-16 — Build (**Onboarding ↔ People-editor field reconciliation; spec 18 §14.4a/§14.6/§14.9** on
  `feat/onboarding-field-coverage`, off `main`, NOT merged). Made onboarding cover **every** People-editor About
  field (+ Pronouns/Birthday) so the self's profile has one home (onboarding), no gaps, no double-asks. Cross-ref
  found 3 gaps + 1 duplicate. **Asked first** (4 forks; user delegated the open ones to me — "no legacy/back-compat
  needed, what do you suggest"): (1) **appearance** → added a basics `appearanceDescription` longText (feeds coaching
  - the self's dream images); (2) **interests** → mapped Joy & play's existing `passions` "What are you into?" →
    `{ field: 'interests', list: true }` (the old `hobbies`→interests question was removed in the trim — reuse, don't
    re-add, so no overlap); (3) **importantDates** → the user asked to **let onboarding capture structured data**, so
    built a **new shared `dateList` answer type** (value `{label,date}[]`, a `DateEntry`): added to `AnswerTypeSchema`,
    widened `IntakeAnswerValue` + questionnaire `Answer.value`, a `DateListControl` (add/type/remove rows) in
    `@selfos/answering`, and a basics `importantDates` question → `Person.importantDates`; the questionnaire builder
    does NOT expose it as authorable (§12, no half-built surface); (4) **healthNotes double-write** (physicalConditions
  - the "anything else" catch-all both targeted it → last-write clobber) → **fixed the proper way**: replaced
    `applyFormField` (per-question, last wins) with **`fillPersonFields`** that **groups answers by target field** —
    string fields JOIN contributors in question order, list fields concat+dedupe, a `dateList` fills importantDates;
    **idempotent** on re-submit (rebuilds from current answers, never appends), and a field locks `private` if ANY
    contributor is private. `isQuestionVisible` already handles array triggers; `isAnswered`/`formatAnswerForDisplay`
  - an `isDateEntryList` guard handle `dateList`. Code-reviewer **ship** (idempotency / join-order / privacy-lock /
    trust-boundary / schema-valid importantDates / widened-union-doesn't-break-relay all verified airtight; applied the
    one should-fix — `:focus-visible` rings on the new date buttons — + a precedence-caveat docstring; left index-key
  - cleared-field-doesn't-clear [pre-existing] as nits). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format,
    **415 core + 11 relay + 498 desktop** unit (+ dateList isAnswered/format, field-coverage [appearance/importantDates/
    passions→interests], healthNotes-join-idempotent, DateListControl RTL), **69 E2E** (the onboarding field-fill test
    now also enters a structured date + appearance → decrypts the vault and asserts `Person.importantDates` +
    `appearanceDescription` round-trip). Visual QA blocked in the web preview (its fake host gates the onboarding form
    behind `aiAvailable` even with a key set) — the new control is instead proven by the real-Electron E2E round-trip +
    RTL. **Lesson: when onboarding owns the self's profile, every editable People field needs exactly ONE promoting
    question — and multiple questions targeting one field must be GROUPED + joined (idempotent), never filled in a
    per-question loop that clobbers (last-write-wins); reuse an existing question (passions→interests) before adding a
    new one to avoid re-introducing overlap.**

- 2026-06-16 — Build (**Distribution — versioning, release builds & the README; SPEC 19 BUILT** on
  `feat/distribution`, off `main`, **NOT merged** — the user cuts the first real release to verify the pipeline).
  CI/packaging/docs only, no app features. **release-please** (manifest mode): `release-please-config.json` +
  `.release-please-manifest.json`, package keyed at the repo **root** (`.`, `release-type: node`,
  `package-name: SelfOS`) so the changelog lands at **root `CHANGELOG.md`** while `apps/desktop/package.json`
  (what About + electron-builder read) is bumped via an `extra-files` JSON updater — the root `package.json`
  bumps in lockstep (NOT pinned at `0.0.0`); `include-component-in-tag: false` → `vX.Y.Z` tags;
  `bump-minor-pre-major: true` and **NOT** `bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major` so a `feat` → minor → first release
  **0.1.0**; `draft: true` (draft-until-asset); `bootstrap-sha` = current `main` HEAD (clean first changelog).
  **`.github/workflows/release.yml`**: job1 release-please (ubuntu) → job2 build-macos (`if releases_created`)
  checks out **`github.sha`** (a _draft_ release has no real git tag yet — created on publish), builds, runs
  `electron-builder --mac --publish always` (GITHUB_TOKEN as GH_TOKEN, `SELFOS_BUILD_SHA: github.sha`), then
  `gh release edit <tag> --draft=false`. **No extra secret, no API key/vault in the build.**
  **electron-builder.yml**: `publish` github block (Highfivery/SelfOS) + a `release:build` script. **About
  enrichment**: a shared `buildInfo.ts` injects `__APP_VERSION__`/`__BUILD_SHA__`/`__BUILD_DATE__` via `define`
  across the electron-vite, web (`vite.web.config`), and `vitest` configs; `AboutVersion` shows
  `v{version} · {sha} · {date}` (omitting a `dev`/empty SHA — **not** over IPC). **README** rewritten
  non-technical (about + "your data is yours" + macOS install incl. the unsigned Gatekeeper bypass +
  bring-your-own-Claude-key cost note + the crisis line verbatim); old technical README → **CONTRIBUTING.md**
  (refreshed Status + a release-process section). **macOS-only, unsigned** for now (signing/notarization,
  auto-update, win/linux = later phases). Code-reviewer **ship**; **doc-auditor caught a real config bug** —
  `bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major: true` would have made the first `feat` → `0.0.1` not `0.1.0`; removed. Gate
  green: typecheck (node + web), lint, format, **411 core + 11 relay + 497 desktop** unit (+2: the
  `__APP_VERSION__`↔`package.json` drift guard + the enriched `AboutVersion` render); a real Electron build
  confirmed the SHA/date land in the renderer bundle. The release pipeline can only be validated by a **real
  first release** — after merge the user merges the release-please PR to confirm the `.dmg` builds/uploads + the
  About version matches. **Lesson: a `define`-injected build global is the clean way to enrich the About version
  (SHA/date) without growing the IPC payload — one shared `buildInfo.ts` keeps the Electron/web/vitest builds +
  the drift-guard test on the same value; and release-please's pre-1.0 bump flags are a footgun
  (`bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major` silently demotes `feat` to a patch — leave it off so `feat` → minor).**
- 2026-06-16 — Build (**Onboarding intake + People-editor consolidation; SPEC 18 §14 amended** on
  `feat/onboarding-people-consolidation`, off `main`, NOT merged awaiting confirm). Six user-flagged cleanups,
  all forks **asked first** (3 AskUserQuestion rounds): (1) **all 63 `rating` 1–5 button-scale questions → 3-label
  sliders** (start/middle/end anchors, like the intimacy ones — authored a neutral mid-label for each via a
  scripted transform; the `rating` helper is deleted, so the intake has NO button scales left); (2) the
  **multi-"Other" write-in space bug** — `MultiChoiceControl` committed (`.split(',').map(trim)`) on every
  keystroke, stripping a trailing space before the next char so multi-word entries ("rock climbing") were
  impossible; now it holds the **raw input text in local state** and renders from that, trimming only the
  committed array; (3) **substances split** — one `multi` "which do you use" + a **per-substance frequency**
  `single` for each (cannabis/cocaine/MDMA/psychedelics/ketamine/Rx), revealed only when selected — which
  required extending `isQuestionVisible` so a **multiChoice branch trigger matches when the selected array
  CONTAINS the value** (`@selfos/core/questionnaires` answering); (4) **livingSituation+liveWith merged** into one
  `multi` "Who do you live with?" (→`livingSituation`); picking **"Children" auto-fills the Children question**
  (in `IntakeFormPanel.onChange`, only when blank, still editable); (5) **repetition audit across ALL sections** —
  trimmed LIFE-NOW to a 5-question identity snapshot (removed hobbies/connected/mood/workSchedule/typicalWeekend/
  workSatisfaction/moneyStress/topStressor/joy/recentChange/perfectDay — all duplicated the deep sections),
  removed exact/near dups (grewUpWhere, dreamDestination, closestExtendedFamily, topPriority) + Health
  anxietyLevel/lowMood (dup of Weighs reflective versions); (6) **People-editor About tab slimmed to
  contact-context** — dropped the editing UI for the 8 deeply-personal self fields (sexualOrientation/
  relationshipStyle/faith/healthNotes/goals/communicationStyle/values/languages) now owned by onboarding, keeping
  the contact-descriptive set + Notes/Relationships/Access/Budget. **Data-loss guard:** `upsertPerson` rebuilds
  the Person from the input, so the slimmed `save()` **carries those 8 fields through from the existing person**
  (omitting would wipe onboarding-collected self data). Code-reviewer **fix-first** (one real **privacy
  regression** it created + I fixed: "Share all"/"Lock all" flipped the ENTIRE `PERSON_FIELD_KEYS` set incl. the
  now-hidden private fields — so "Share all" would silently un-privatize a subject's sexual orientation/health/
  faith with no visible toggle to counter it; now scoped to a `VISIBLE_FIELD_KEYS` subset, preserving hidden
  keys' lock state — +test). Clarified the reviewer's 2nd finding: intake facts are **hardcoded `shareable:false`**
  at synthesis, so the non-restricted substance facts are own-context-only (NOT a leak); the dormant per-question
  `restricted` flag (synthesis only honors section-level) is filed as a follow-up task. Gate green: typecheck
  (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **410 core + 11 relay + 495 desktop** unit (+ multi-branch [answering core +
  QuestionnaireForm RTL], multi-Other space RTL, People carry-through + Share-all-preserves-hidden-lock RTL),
  **69 E2E** (+1: liveWith→Children auto-fill + substance reveals its frequency; updated the People About +
  shareability E2E for the slimmed editor; intimacy-conditionals + grouped-form still green). Visual QA via the
  web preview (the slimmed People About tab — contact-context fields only, Share/Lock-all, per-field toggles, no
  overflow, no console errors); the slider rendering is the unchanged proven intimacy path (catalog data only).
  Synced spec 18 §14.3/§14.4/§14.4a/§14.6. **Lesson: removing a field's editing UI while it stays in
  `PERSON_FIELD_KEYS` makes a bulk "Share all" silently un-privatize it (no toggle to counter) — scope bulk
  share/lock controls to the VISIBLE keys and preserve hidden keys' state; and since `upsertPerson` rebuilds from
  the input, any field you stop editing must be carried through from the existing record or it's wiped.**
- 2026-06-16 — Build (**External-compat relay-page outcome write-back — external compatibility is now COMPLETE
  end-to-end; 08 §17.12-D**; on `feat/questionnaire-explicit-gen`, NOT merged). After both have answered + the
  sender generated the alignment report, the sender pushes it back to the external recipient from Results, and
  the recipient sees it on their relay link. Built in 3 committed parts: **(2a) crypto/mailbox/client** — the
  content key (which decrypts everything for the recipient, normally only in their link fragment) is now ALSO
  stored **wrapped under the master key** (`Assignment.relay.contentKeyWrapped`) so the sender can re-seal an
  outcome the recipient opens with that same fragment key; a sealed **`RelayResult`** (`report`/`thanks`) +
  `sealResult`/`openResult`; a drain-secret-authed Worker `POST /api/admin/result` (`putResult` patches the
  mailbox in place; `unlock` releases `sealedResult`). **(2b) relay page** — a returning, already-answered
  recipient sees the **report** (decrypted client-side) or a **"waiting for results"** state (a compatibility
  submit lands there, not the plain thank-you). **(2c) bridge + UI** — `assignments:publishCompatResult` (sender-
  scoped, needs the report, pushes to every external member) + a **"Share results"** action shown only when the
  group has an external member + a report. **Real fix the end-to-end test caught:** `generateAlignment` had
  hard-required **both** members to be `recipient.kind === 'person'`, so it **rejected any group with an external
  participant — external compatibility could never align at all**; it now names an external participant from
  their relay `displayName`. **Coverage:** the relay round-trip (mint→answer-via-relay→drain→align→publish→
  recipient-unlock-decrypts-report) is the **coreBridge integration test** (the renderer can't reach the in-main
  fake relay — the same reason existing compat/relay answer flows are coreBridge-tested, not Playwright); both UI
  surfaces are RTL (the Share button + confirmation + its absence for a household group; the relay page report /
  waiting states). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **408 core + 491 desktop + 11 relay**
  unit. Synced 08 §17.12-D + §16.7 matrix §H. **Lesson: a feature where the recipient's only key lives in their
  link fragment can still get a server-pushed update IF you also wrap that key under the master key at send time
  — then the sender re-seals; the relay still only ever holds ciphertext. And a guard written for the common case
  (`recipient.kind === 'person'`) silently disables the whole feature for the new case — the end-to-end test
  caught what the unit tests, scoped to person-pairs, structurally couldn't.**
- 2026-06-16 — Flow-coherence fixes (**08 §17.12 — remove duplicate person-pickers; the user caught them, not
  the tests**). A whole-flow walk found two redundant person selections left by the recipient-first model.
  **(A)** Dropped the "About a specific person?" picker + toggles from Draft with AI — it re-asked "who is this
  for?"; generation now auto-tailors to the bound recipient's shareable context (+ their history for de-dup),
  the author's own data still always feeds; the generate IPC drops `targetPersonId`/`includeTarget`/
  `includeRelationship` (the bridge derives them). **(B)** Compatibility joined the recipient-first model — it's
  always **you + the one recipient chosen at the start step**; the Send panel's "Who's being compared?" toggle +
  both person-pickers + the "two other people" mode are gone; `assignmentsCreateCompatibility` takes only
  `{ questionnaireId }`. **External-recipient compatibility is the NEXT slice** (household-only for now): the
  external recipient answers via relay, the sender answers in-app, then once both are in the sender pushes the
  sealed outcome (per visibility — thanks / the joint report) back to the recipient's relay page from Results;
  contextOnly hidden for external. Gate: typecheck/lint/format, 402 core + 486 desktop unit, 68 E2E; visual QA
  of the compat start step + send panel (one clean "Compare you with" picker, no duplicate). **Lesson (now §7
  DoD): a green test suite proves each screen FUNCTIONS, not that the FLOW is coherent — walk the complete flow
  end-to-end and hunt for the same thing asked twice, colliding labels, and controls left stale by a change.**
- 2026-06-16 — **REVERT + hard rule (I violated "never assume" and it cost the user real tokens).** I assumed
  the intimacy "No usable questions" failure was a Claude content-policy **refusal** and twice rewrote the
  generation prompt (ending in a weak "sexual-wellness register"), when the real cause was a **thinking-token
  budget bug** (§17.10) — the prompt was always fine. The user (rightly furious) had me **revert the §17.2
  prompt reframe**: `intimacyExplicitFraming` is restored to the genuinely-explicit §16.5 framing ("Write
  genuinely explicit, specific questions… frank, plain language…"), and the `topics.test.ts`/`aiServices.test.ts`
  assertions restored. **Kept:** the §16.5b fallback removal, the §17.10 thinking fix, all of §17.3/§17.4/§17.5.
  **New HARD rule (CLAUDE.md §6 + memory [[always-ask-never-assume]] + [[adaptive-thinking-shares-maxtokens]]):
  NEVER fix a cause you only ASSUMED — diagnose the real root cause against the LIVE system first; never assume
  a model failure is a content refusal (suspect token starvation/truncation/parse-drop/wrong-model first); the
  offline fakes HIDE model-call bugs (always return canned JSON) so verify against the live model before
  touching the prompt; if you can't verify, say so and ASK — a fix on an unverified guess IS a guess.** Gate:
  typecheck/lint/format, 402 core + 487 desktop unit. On `feat/questionnaire-explicit-gen`.
- 2026-06-16 — Fix (**intimacy generation "No usable questions" was a thinking-budget bug, NOT a refusal**; 08
  §17.10, on `feat/questionnaire-explicit-gen`). User still hit "No usable questions came back" for intimacy
  explicit/unfiltered **every time** after the §17.2 wellness reframing. Diagnosed against the **live** API (the
  user supplied a key — **flagged it as now-exposed-in-transcript, rotate it**): the model does NOT refuse — it
  returns good explicit JSON. The bug: `anthropicClient.stream` uses `thinking:{type:'adaptive'}` and
  **`max_tokens` is the COMBINED thinking + output budget**; on **sonnet** (default) the long intimacy prompt's
  adaptive thinking consumed the whole 1500-token budget → `stop_reason:max_tokens`, **empty output** → parse
  fails → REFUSED. (General = short prompt → little thinking → worked; opus thinks less → worked; that's why
  only intimacy/sonnet failed.) **Fix:** `ClaudeStreamOptions` gains `extendedThinking?` (default on — chat keeps
  adaptive thinking); the Electron + iOS stream clients omit `thinking` when false; `runClaude`
  (generate/improve/variant/gap-finder) disables it + generation budget → 2500; a cut-off/empty reply now reports
  "draft was cut off, try again" distinctly from a no-JSON refusal. Verified live (sonnet, both tiers, thinking
  off → `end_turn` + valid JSON). User chose to **skip** the earlier-requested admin-editable-prompt Settings
  feature (its premise — "the prompt is the problem" — was wrong). Gate: typecheck/lint/format, 400 core + 487
  desktop unit (+2). **Lesson: adaptive `thinking` shares the `max_tokens` budget — a bounded structured-JSON
  call MUST disable it (or reserve a big budget), or heavy thinking silently truncates the JSON to empty; a
  symptom that looks like a content refusal can be pure token starvation; and the offline fake Claude hides this
  class of bug (always returns canned JSON) — diagnose against the LIVE model before touching the prompt.** (See
  memory `adaptive-thinking-shares-maxtokens`.)
- 2026-06-15 — Spec + Build (**Questionnaires SPEC 08 §17 — recipient-bound questionnaires + in-policy explicit
  framing + recipient-aware de-dup**; APPROVED + BUILT on `feat/questionnaire-explicit-gen`, NOT merged). User
  rejected my guessed §16.5b fallback ("NEVER assume… ALWAYS ASK"): I removed it, wrote a spec amendment (§17),
  and asked every decision before coding. **Decisions (all user-confirmed):** (1) fix intimacy refusals by
  **reworking the per-tier prompt**, not a fallback — recast `explicit`/`unfiltered` as a **sexual-wellness
  self-assessment** (health register, not erotica) so the live model complies in-policy; a refusal now surfaces
  the calm error (no canned questions). (2) **Every questionnaire is bound to ONE recipient, chosen FIRST** (a
  new `NewQuestionnaireStart` step — full-width Selects, never a scrolling SegmentedControl §12); never several;
  household OR external; **Duplicate** re-targets; **compatibility is exempt** (its two participants are chosen
  at send). The recipient picker LEFT the send panels (the bridge derives the recipient from the def + rejects a
  wrong-kind send). (3) **Recipient-aware de-dup** — generation feeds the bound household recipient's **full**
  answered content (profile + their Insights [intake/sessions/dreams/questionnaires] + the exact prompts of
  questionnaires already asked of them), assembled **host-side**, to Claude as **avoid-only** grounding; the
  author **never** sees it (only generated questions return), and the prompt **forbids the model from quoting/
  referencing** it ("steer clear, NOT mention"). User **knowingly relaxed** the own-context-only rule for this
  generation path (output boundary preserved). External/compat skip de-dup; the "about a person" context
  defaults to the recipient (overridable). 5 slices, each gated. **Lesson: the recipient-required rule belongs
  at the AUTHORING boundary (the start step) + the SEND path, NOT in the structural `validateQuestionnaire` that
  `createAssignment` calls — putting it there breaks every core send of a recipient-less compat snapshot. And a
  long-labelled SegmentedControl ("Compatibility (two people)") scrolls-x at 390px (a §12 failure) → use
  full-width Selects.** Code-reviewer **ship** (privacy boundary verified airtight at the output seam — the
  recipient's private content never returns to the author; +1 stale-comment nit fixed). Gate green: typecheck
  (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **400 core + 8 relay + 487 desktop** unit, **68 E2E** (recipient-bound
  decrypt + Duplicate + 390px start-step guard; all questionnaire flows re-pointed through the start step). Visual
  QA via real-app screenshots (start step desktop + 390px, the "For:" builder header). Synced spec 08 §17 +
  §16.7 matrix §H. **NOT merged — user reviews the explicit-prompt wording (§17.2/§16.5) before merge.**
- 2026-06-15 — Build (**Questionnaires §16 slice-4 follow-ups — 4 feedback fixes + the §16.5b explicit-starter
  fallback** [SUPERSEDED by §17 — the fallback was removed]; on `feat/questionnaire-explicit-gen`, NOT merged).
  Four user-flagged fixes: (1) the "Draft with AI" Four user-flagged fixes: (1) the "Draft with AI"

  while drafting, not just a disabled button; (2) `appendGenerated` drops the **leading blank** generated question;
  (3) **§16.5b** — when the live Claude model **still declines** an intimacy explicit/unfiltered draft (the §16.5
  context-first framing doesn't always work — a model-side policy call I can't reproduce against the offline fake),
  `intimacyStarterQuestions(topics, tier, count)` (new `packages/core/src/questionnaires/intimacyStarters.ts`)
  seeds **editable, frank starter questions from the merged topic inventory** instead of stranding the Owner on
  "No usable questions came back" — fallback fires **only** on the intimacy explicit/unfiltered REFUSED path
  (NO_KEY/BUDGET/ERROR + any other type/tier still surface the calm error; returns `ok:true` + a "the AI held back,
  so I added explicit starter questions" note); (4) the Settings + inline topic-add controls are **textareas that
  add ONE topic at a time** (user was explicit: "should NOT be one per line!!! … add one at a time"; owner-only,
  `people.manage`). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **399 core + 8 relay + 480 desktop**

  §16.10 build status. **Lesson: the §16.5 explicit-context framing reduces but doesn't eliminate model refusals
  for graphic sexual content — pair the prompt with a deterministic, inventory-seeded fallback so an explicit
  intimacy questionnaire never dead-ends, and gate the fallback to the intimacy/explicit REFUSED path so a real
  NO_KEY/BUDGET/ERROR or a non-intimacy refusal still surfaces honestly.**
- 2026-06-15 — Build (**Questionnaires §16 slice 4b — owner-extensible intimacy-topics UI; SPEC 08 §16 is now
  FULLY BUILT**; on `feat/questionnaire-explicit-gen`, NOT merged). The owner manages the shared
  `INTIMACY_TOPICS` inventory two ways (spec 08 §16.5a): an **owner-only Settings surface**
  (`questionnaires.intimacyTopics`, **admin-only**, 18+, vault-scoped → `IntimacyTopicsControl` — built-ins
  read-only + the Owner's custom activities/fantasies as removable chips + an add field each) **and** an
  **inline "add a topic"** in the intimacy builder's "Draft with AI" panel (shown only to an owner authoring an
  intimacy questionnaire at the explicit/unfiltered tier). Both write the SAME shared custom lists. **IPC seam:**
  `questionnaires:intimacyTopics` (read = `questionnaires.create`, returns built-in + custom split) /
  `:addIntimacyTopic` / `:removeIntimacyTopic` (add/remove = **owner-only, `people.manage`** — the lists are
  household-wide); the consensual-adult boundary is enforced by the generation prompt + the model (trusted
  owner, the full-access role), **not** a keyword filter. Reused existing primitives (Banner/Field/TextInput/
  Button + chips) → no new `/gallery` primitive. Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, 397
  core + 8 relay + **478 desktop** unit (+bridge owner-adds/member-reads-only gating, +`IntimacyTopicsControl`
  RTL [3]), **67 E2E** (+1: owner adds a topic in Settings + via the inline builder add → both persist to the
  plain `config/questionnaires.json` [decrypt-free read]). **Visual QA** via the web preview (the admin-only
  18+ control: chips + add rows, the inline panel add) — 0 overflow (the only x-scroll is the by-design
  narrow-width settings section nav). **Lesson: a household-wide owner-managed list = read gated on the author
  capability (so any author's builder/AI can use it) but add/remove gated on `people.manage` (owner-only); the
  inline builder affordance hides for non-owners, and the boundary lives in the prompt + model, never a filter.
  Spec 08 §16 (the 2026-06-15 audit fixes) is COMPLETE — §16.1–§16.7 all built.**
- 2026-06-15 — Build (**Questionnaires §16 slice 4a — explicit generation + shared `INTIMACY_TOPICS`
  foundation**; spec 08 §16.5/§16.5a, on `feat/questionnaire-explicit-gen` off the **merged** `main`, NOT
  merged). After slices 1–3+5+§16.6 merged (`d4ee441`) and the concurrent `feat/intimacy-questions` work
  landed, built the previously-paused slice 4: **(§16.5) tier-distinct explicit generation** — a new
  `intimacyExplicitFraming(tier, topics)` in `aiPrompts.ts` **positively requests** genuinely explicit,
  specific questions for an **intimacy** questionnaire at the `explicit`/`unfiltered` tiers (unfiltered = most
  graphic, explicit a notch below), seeds the in-policy topic inventory, and states the **consensual-adult
  boundary in-prompt** (taboo only as fantasy/roleplay; NEVER minors/real-non-consent/illegal; within Anthropic
  policy) — fixing the user's complaint that "unfiltered" produced tame emotional-closeness questions. The
  shared `SAFETY` prefix is **not** loosened, and non-intimacy types/tiers keep the conservative note.
  **(§16.5a foundation)** extracted the intimacy `ACTIVITIES`/`commonFantasies` out of `intakeCatalog.ts` into
  ONE shared `@selfos/core/intimacy` constant (`INTIMACY_TOPICS` = `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES` + `INTIMACY_FANTASIES`)
  imported by **both** the intake block (spec-18 sync — intake now imports it + appends `'Other'`, behaviour
  unchanged) **and** questionnaire generation; `mergedIntimacyTopics(custom)` combines built-ins + the Owner's
  **custom additions** (vault prefs `customIntimacyActivities`/`customIntimacyFantasies` in
  `config/questionnaires.json`, additive-optional — no schemaVersion bump; `read`/`add`/`removeCustomIntimacyTopic`).
  Generation reads the **merged** inventory. Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **397
  core + 8 relay + 474 desktop** unit (+`intimacy/topics` [7: built-in/merge/dedup + the per-tier explicit
  framing], +customTypeService intimacy [3], +an aiServices capture test proving the explicit framing + merged
  inventory reach the model). **Slice 4b remaining:** the owner-only Settings surface (18+, admin-only) + the
  inline builder "add a topic" to manage the custom lists, + the explicit-tier E2E rows. **Lesson: a shared
  owner-extensible inventory is one `@selfos/core` constant + a `merged…(custom)` helper reading vault prefs —
  the static intake catalog imports the BUILT-IN list directly (behaviour-preserving), and only the AI-generation
  path (which already reads the vault) merges in the owner's custom additions.**
- 2026-06-15 — Build (**Questionnaires audit fixes — SPEC 08 §16 slices 1–3 + 5 BUILT** on
  `feat/questionnaire-audit-fixes` **in an isolated git worktree**, NOT merged; **slice 4 paused**). The audit
  (memory `questionnaire-audit-fixes-2026-06-15`) found real bugs + the user's enhancements. **§16 marked
  Approved.** Built: **(1, §16.1) compat participant model** — compatibility now supports **you + someone else**
  (the sender IS a participant — the default; pickers exclude the sender) AND **two other people**; the only
  invalid pairing is the same person twice (the old "sender can't be a participant" rejection is gone).
  `compatibilityDisclosure` reworked to take participant context (`otherParticipantName`/`senderName`/
  `viewerIsSender`) and name the **real other participant**, never the sender-as-third-party (it's shown to
  recipients — honesty guard held); the send panel got a full-width-`Select` mode toggle (§12 — NOT a scrolling
  SegmentedControl), sender pre-selected + locked. **(2, §16.2) `contextOnly` visibility** — a 4th mode: both
  answer, **NO report, no raw sharing**; each participant's OWN answers distill into an **auto-approved,
  own-context-only Insight** (subject = that participant, `shareable:false`) feeding their own coach;
  **sender-triggered from Results** ("Update both coaches", explicit spend §3.4). `distillContextOnly`
  pre-validates both submitted **before any spend** (code-reviewer fix). **(3, §16.3/§16.4) Save→Send + Title**
  — the builder's **Save now keeps you on the saved questionnaire** (no close); **Send appears only once saved**
  (create → then send, no strand); **Title moved below "Draft with AI"**; AI generation returns a `{title,
questions}` object and the title **fills only when the field is empty** (never clobbers). **(5, §16.7) the E2E
  matrix** for the built features — contextOnly with a **vault-decrypt** assertion (per-participant own-context
  insights, no report, no cross-exposure), you+someone-else send-panel toggle, AI-title + Save→Send two-step;
  **fixed every existing questionnaire E2E** for the new flow (Create→"Create draft"; Send-after-Save; footer
  "Done"→"Close" to disambiguate from the send-panel "Done"). **Decisions (asked):** contextOnly = auto-approve
  into each own context + sender-triggers-from-Results; **slice 4 PAUSED** (user chose) until the concurrent
  `feat/intimacy-questions` work merges (it rewrites `intakeCatalog.ts`, which §16.5a must extract `INTIMACY_TOPICS`
  from). Gate green each slice: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **385 core + 8 relay + 474 desktop**
  unit, **65 E2E**; code-reviewer per slice (slice-1 ship +3 nits, slice-2 fix-first [pre-validation + disclosure
  copy], slice-3 ship). Visual QA via the web preview (compat mode toggle, contextOnly builder option,
  Title-below-AI, Save→Send) — 0 overflow. **Lesson 1: a concurrent agent sharing the working tree can hijack the
  single HEAD (it switched to `feat/intimacy-questions` mid-session) — do feature work in a `git worktree` and
  commit only your files there; when a shared file (`schemas.ts`) holds both sides' hunks, stage your hunk with a
  `git apply --cached` patch. Lesson 2: a Playwright `click` on a button that flips to a busy state ("Drafting…")
  hangs the default post-click wait 30s — use `{noWaitAfter:true}`; and a generated questionnaire with a still-
  blank Question 1 leaves `canSave` false, so "Create draft" stays disabled and the next click hangs.**
- 2026-06-15 — Build (**onboarding intake redesign — hybrid form/chat + self-maintaining profile; SPEC 18
  §14–§15 BUILT** on `feat/onboarding-redesign`, NOT merged). User: the all-chat intake is slow for simple
  facts, the open prompts are too generic (people abandon), the intimacy question gets skipped — and "the more
  info the AI has the better." Reworked into a **hybrid**: a short gated **`core`** of quick structured **forms**
  - **`invited`** deeper/sensitive sections, with **AI `chat`** reserved for family / your story / what weighs on
    you. **~180 specific questions** (broad prompts gone), incl. a **comprehensive, explicit, branched 18+ intimacy
    block** (orientation, full sexual history, current partner, acts & specifics, body/grooming, fantasies/porn,
    wellbeing, boundaries). **Asked-first** (2 deep rounds): the 4 forks (§14.13 — short-core-gates / promote-useful-
    answers-to-real-fields / owner-sees-intimacy / reuse-the-questionnaire-engine) + the comprehensive question
    inventory reviewed before coding. **Boundary held:** consensual-adult sexuality only — taboo _fantasies_ (CNC,
    etc.) are in as fantasy/roleplay; minors / real non-consent / illegal are never presented as activities. Reuses
    the questionnaire `Question` shape + `@selfos/answering` renderer (branching). **5 promoted additive `Person`
    fields** (relationshipStatus/parentalStatus/livingSituation shared; sexualOrientation/relationshipStyle private-
    by-default). **§15 self-maintaining profile:** drift detection **rides the session/dream/questionnaire analysis
    passes (no extra AI spend)** → confirm-before-apply `ProfileUpdateSuggestion`s + a Home "Keep your profile
    fresh" card (sessions producer built; dreams/questionnaires deferred, same pattern). 3 slices (core → renderer →
    freshness) + 2 follow-ups (go-deeper chat, People-editor fields). Gate green each slice: typecheck (node +
    web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **371 core + 447 desktop + 8 relay** unit, **61 E2E** (the 3 onboarding E2E reworked
    for the form flow); visual QA at desktop + 390px. **Lesson: `submitSectionForm` fills fields from forms with NO
    AI — the old chat `[[SELFOS:FIELD]]` marker machinery is gone; a form section spends nothing, so the gated
    first-run is fast + cheap. Restricted (intimacy/trauma) facts are flagged at synthesis from the TRUSTED catalog
    (`sectionRefRestricted`), never the model, so a sensitive fact can't leak past §8.4 by a model mislabel.**
- 2026-06-14 — Refactor + bug fixes (**super-admin removed → the Owner is the full-access role; +
  per-person login & onboarding-gate fixes**; user flagged 4 issues). **(#3, the big one)** The concealed
  **super-admin** (passphrase + in-memory inspect flag + the long-press-version unlock + `config/superadmin.enc`
  - `superadmin:*` IPC) and the **break-glass raw-access audit log** (`auditService`, the
    `RawAccessAuditEntry`/`RawAccessAuditLog` schemas + `config/raw-access-audit.enc`, the `/audit` route+nav+viewer,
    `audit:list` + `intake:revealRestricted`, the reveal "ceremony") are **deleted**. `roleAllows(role, cap)` now
    returns `true` for **any** capability (incl. the `EXPLICIT_GRANT_ONLY` `questionnaires.readRaw` /
    `intake.readRestricted`) when `role.id === 'owner'` — the **Owner is the super admin**; the Owner column in the
    Roles matrix is locked all-on; `EXPLICIT_GRANT_ONLY` caps still ship OFF for non-owner roles and need an explicit
    toggle. Restricted intake facts + `senderSeesAll` raw answers now surface **directly** to the Owner (via the
    normal `insights:list` / `assignments:revealRaw`, no audit) and stay **redacted** for everyone else — and the
    defense-in-depth exclusion of restricted facts from every _other_ person's `buildContext` is unchanged. Decisions
    (AskUserQuestion): "Full access" for the Owner + "remove the audit log entirely" (reconciled to no-ceremony,
    no-log) + "auto-give each person a Member login." **(#3 also)** The **Owner switches to any person with no PIN**
    (`session:setActive` skips PIN when leaving the Owner; returning _to_ the Owner still needs the Owner's PIN).
    **(#1 + #2)** Two bugs that motivated this: a previously-created person wasn't gated into onboarding and a
    newly-created person didn't appear in the switcher — both root-caused to (a) **stale built-in role maps** (vaults
    freeze role→capability at creation, so `intake.own` added later wasn't granted) → fixed with read-time
    **`reconcileRole`** in `getAccessConfig`, and (b) **no login account** for new subjects → fixed with
    **`ensureMemberAccounts`** (idempotent no-PIN Member accounts, in `peopleSave` for new + `accessGet` backfill).
    **(#4)** The `basics` intake section now asks each profile field one at a time (pronouns/gender/birthday/location/
    languages/ethnicity/occupation) so onboarding auto-fills the profile. New test helper `elevateToOwner()` replaces
    the removed `superAdmin:true` renderer-test bypass. **Code-reviewer fix-first** (2 should-fixes: the
    owner-PIN-free switch was implemented at the bridge but not wired into the **`PersonPicker`** UI — now it
    skips the PIN prompt when the active person is the Owner **and not on the LockScreen** (`locked` is a
    deliberate re-auth gate, so PINs always apply there); + a no-op `DreamImagePanel` test `afterEach`; plus nits:
    dropped the dead `superAdminPassphraseHash` schema field, collapsed the now-redundant `roleAllows` branch,
    freshened stale "audited" comments). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format,
    **361 core + 437 desktop + 8 relay** unit (incl. a new bridge test: a non-owner `senderSeesAll` sender reveals
    ONLY with granted `readRaw`; owner-PIN-free-switch bridge + Switcher UI tests; owner full-access), **61 E2E**
    (all green, incl. the owner→member switch, the LockScreen still requires the owner's PIN, + the Member
    onboarding hard-gate). Synced specs `04` (the model rewrite) / `08` / `18` / `02` /
    `10` (+ `06`/`07`/`09`/`11`/`12`/`13`/`14` incidental). On `refactor/owner-full-access` off `main`; NOT merged
    (awaiting user confirm). **Lesson: a vault freezes each built-in role's capability map at creation, so a
    capability added to code defaults later is NOT granted to existing non-owner roles — reconcile built-in roles at
    READ time (fill missing default keys, preserve explicit toggles) rather than migrating; and storage scoping isn't
    enough for a person to be switch-to-able — they need an actual login account, so auto-create one for every subject.**
- 2026-06-15 — Change + feedback (**onboarding is now a HARD requirement for Members**, spec 18 §3.1; user:
  the dismissible auto-route "felt buggy" — "a person MUST go through it first… directed to fill it out").
  Replaced the auto-route-once + nudge with a **full-screen onboarding gate** in `AppShell`: a Member
  (`intake.own`, **not** the Owner, **not** super-admin) is taken over by onboarding on every login until
  `IntakeSession.status === 'complete'` (the portrait is generated; sections may be skipped but the flow must
  be worked through). **Asked first** the 3 forks (full-screen w/ AI-escape; done = portrait generated;
  Members-only). The header stays (switch person / lock) + the crisis footer is always present (a gate, not a
  dead-end); `AppHeader` gained `hideNav` to drop the hamburger. The **Owner + super-admin are exempt** (the
  Owner sets up AI, which the intake requires — gating them would trap a keyless first-run owner); they keep
  the voluntary nudge. On completion the finish navigates to `/onboarding` so the just-written portrait stays
  on screen (now with the sidebar); Members keep the Onboarding nav entry to revisit. Removed the auto-route
  effect + `autoRoutedToOnboarding`. Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **442 desktop**
  unit, **64 E2E** (+1: a Member is hard-gated [no app nav, crisis present] → finishes → the gate releases;
  the 7 member-switch/join tests now seed a **completed** intake so they exercise the real member experience
  instead of passing vacuously under the gate — `seedCompletedIntake`/`completeIntakeFor` helpers). On
  `feat/personal-onboarding` (merged to `main`). **Lesson: a hard full-screen gate keyed on a per-person
  status quietly breaks/voids EVERY E2E that signs in as that persona to test other features — they must seed
  the gate-release state (completed onboarding) or they fail (assert a feature is reachable) or pass for the
  wrong reason (a "nav is absent" check is vacuously true when the gate hides ALL nav).**
- 2026-06-14 — Build (**Personal onboarding — the "getting to know you" intake; SPEC 18 BUILT**;
  [18-personal-onboarding](docs/specs/18-personal-onboarding.md)). The **4th Insight producer** — an AI-guided,
  resumable self-interview across 10 sections that **auto-fills the owner-only `Person` profile** as the person
  answers and synthesizes a member-facing **portrait `Insight` (`source:'intake'`)** feeding their OWN
  `buildContext`. Reuses `05` streaming + `06` metering, the `09` analysis→Insight + meter-before-parse pattern,
  `15` per-field shareability, the `16` 18+ ack, and the `08` break-glass/audit. **Asked first** the 3 build
  forks: (1) synthesis cadence = **light per-section reflection (auto on section complete) + an explicit final
  portrait** (tap to generate, never auto-spend); (2) the intimacy block's 18+ ack is **SHARED** with guided
  sessions (`guidance/prefs.enc adultAcknowledged` — acking once anywhere unlocks both); (3) a brand-new person
  is **auto-routed once** to `/onboarding`, dismissible, with a persistent Home nudge + nav dot until complete.
  **Core** `@selfos/core/intake`: `intakeCatalog` (10 sections, static openers, a `directFields` map, the
  interviewer addendum appended **AFTER** PERSONA+SAFETY+context, §8.1) + `intakeService` (runTurn streams +
  meters `intake.interview`; direct answers fill the owner-only profile mid-interview via an embedded
  **`[[SELFOS:FIELD:key=value]]`** marker — stripped from saved+streamed text, **only catalog-declared keys
  honored**, sensitive ones → `privateFields`; synthesize = section reflection or the full portrait, metering
  `intake.synthesize` before parse, re-synth reuses the insight id + carries shareable choices forward).
  **Schema** (all additive, **no schemaVersion bump**): `InsightSource += 'intake'`, `InsightFact.restricted?`,
  `Insight.provenance.intakeSection?`, generalized `RawAccessAuditEntry` (action enum + optional
  `assignmentId`/`subjectPersonId`/`subjectName`), new `IntakeSession`/`IntakeSection`. **Capabilities:**
  `intake.own` (Member ON) + `intake.readRestricted` (**EXPLICIT_GRANT_ONLY** — off even for the Owner).
  **Seam:** `intake:getState/runTurn(stream)/skipSection/acknowledgeAdult/synthesize/revealRestricted` — gated
  `intake.own` + active-person-scoped in the bridge; the **restricted sections** ("what weighs on you" +
  intimacy) and their facts are **redacted from the owner's normal Memory reads** (`insightsList`) and
  reachable only via the **audited `intake:revealRestricted`** (writes the audit entry **before** returning,
  super-admin OR `intake.readRestricted` only). API key host-side; dedicated `intake:chunk` stream.
  **Renderer:** the sectioned onboarding flow (reuses Sessions `Composer`+`CrisisFooter`, skip/"go deeper"

  (reset on `activePerson.id`), the Home `OnboardingCard` nudge, the auto-route, the AuditLog `revealRestricted`
  row, and the Memory **audited reveal** affordance for intake insights. Code-reviewer **fix-first** (one
  **blocker**): a Memory edit→save dropped `restricted`/`shareableWith` off facts (the renderer patch carries
  only `{id,text,shareable}`) → `updateInsight` now **merges by id** to carry them forward, AND
  `summarizeForContext`/`buildLinkedPeopleContext` now **exclude restricted facts from EVERY other person's
  context** regardless of `shareable` (defense in depth) — so a restricted fact is structurally own-context-only
  and can't be un-restricted by an edit. Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **362 core +
  442 desktop + 8 relay** unit (+intakeService/intakeCatalog, +bridge intake round-trip incl. break-glass,

  `restricted` flag is a server-owned invariant — a renderer edit payload only carries `{id,text,shareable}`, so

  exclude `restricted` facts from others' context independently of `shareable`, or one Memory edit silently

- 2026-06-14 — Build (**App-refresh package G — the Home dashboard; SPEC 17 APPROVED + BUILT — the 2026-06
  app refresh (A–G) is COMPLETE**; [17-home-dashboard](docs/specs/17-home-dashboard.md) §13). Replaced the
  static `routes/Home.tsx` with a **per-active-person card dashboard** under `routes/home/` (a `Home`
  container + `ContinueCard` / `SuggestionsCard` / `WellbeingCard` / `DreamsCard` / `MemoryCard` /
  `InboxCard` / `GettingStarted` + pure `wellbeing.ts` / `greeting.ts` + one CSS module), **composed on the
  renderer from the existing per-person stores — NO new IPC** (conversation/dream/dreamPattern/insight/inbox
  /guidance). Each card **self-hides when empty**; a brand-new person sees a warm **getting-started** state
  instead of a wall of empties; loads run on mount + `activePerson.id` change (the per-person rule). **Asked
  first** the two genuine build forks (spec §13): (1) the Suggested card shows 16's **cached** guided
  suggestions on load (NO spend) and the guided generate/refresh **and** the `08` questionnaire gap-finder
  are **explicit-tap only** (spend on tap, never on load — honoring §3.4); (2) the Continue card shows
  per-session `$` via the existing **`SessionCostIndicator`** (admin `$` + `AdminOnlyBadge`, member a
  dollar-free budget bar — the established redaction-at-the-bridge rule). The **wellbeing read is
  deterministic** ("steadier/heavier/lifting", computed from the metric points, no AI → always works, no
  spend); a context-aware **greeting** (time-of-day + name + one status line). **Safety (§7):**
  `CrisisFooter` + the not-medical line are always present; the wellbeing trend is framed gently; a **recent**
  crisis-flag (bounded to the latest 3 analyzed sessions) surfaces a supportive resources-first Banner.
  Reuses `LineChart` (mood + energy, −1..1) + `FrequencyBars` (the dream pattern highlight) + the launcher's
  `GuidedExerciseCard` — **no new design-system primitive, so no `/gallery` change**. Threaded a Home→builder
  handoff: exported `toSeed` from `SuggestedPanel` + a **router-state seed pickup** in `Questionnaires`.
  Code-reviewer **ship** (per-person isolation, no-spend-on-load, and admin-$ redaction all verified airtight;
  applied: bound `hasRecentCrisis` to the latest 3 sessions [was unbounded → a stale flag stuck forever];
  removed dead CSS; `overflow-wrap` on the dream snippet; a `ready`-gate to kill the empty-grid flash; dropped
  the InboxCard head icon; the §5 `UsageCard` doc drift). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint,
  format, **340 core + 430 desktop + 8 relay** unit (+greeting/wellbeing pure-helper tests, +5 Home RTL —

  **61 E2E** (+2: brand-new → getting-started; a seeded person sees the cards + Resume opens the session +
  390px inner-scrollbar guard). **Visual QA** via the web preview at desktop (light + dark — the 3-up card
  reflow with Continue/Suggested full-width) + 390px (single column, 0 overflow, no console errors). On
  `feat/home-dashboard` off `main`; NOT merged (awaiting user confirm). **Lesson: when one card's data lives
  in an all-people store (`insightStore`, no per-person `reset()`), per-person isolation is the CONSUMER's
  `subjectPersonId` filter, not a store reset — and it holds across the AppShell-reset-vs-Home-load effect
  race because Home's async `load()`s resolve AFTER AppShell's synchronous resets. Also: a "recent" crisis
  surface must be bounded (latest N sessions), or a single old flag keeps the supportive banner up forever.**
- 2026-06-14 — Build (**App-refresh package F — richer dream image style; SPEC 13 §15 APPROVED + BUILT**;
  [13-dream-images](docs/specs/13-dream-images.md) §15, amends §5.3/§6). Renderer + settings + one core
  prompt-builder param — **no schema, IPC, provider, or metering change**. Nothing was unstated (all forks
  resolved in §15.5), so no new questions. **Expanded `dreams.imageStyle`** from a 4-value enum to **~20
  family-grouped presets** (Painted / Drawn / Stylized / Photographic-ish) sharing **ONE
  `IMAGE_STYLE_PRESETS` constant** (new `app/routes/dreams/imageStyles.ts`) used by **both** the Settings
  select and the `DreamImagePanel` picker — both render native `<optgroup>`s; the schema field stays a **free
  string** (the four original values retained, so pre-expansion dreams still resolve to a label), and a
  legacy/unknown stored value renders as a **fallback option** in both surfaces (§15.4). **Added Settings-only
  `dreams.imageStyleNotes`** (textarea, max 300, default empty) — the dreamer's free-text style direction —
  threaded through `buildImagePromptInput`'s new optional **`styleNotes`** param (appends
  `Additional style direction: …` after the style line, before the framing; **blank ⇒ no line**) and read
  host-side in `coreBridge.dreamGenerateImage`. **NO per-image notes** — the `dreams:generateImage` IPC is
  unchanged. **Softened** the baseline `DREAMLIKE_FRAMING` + `DISTILLATION_INSTRUCTION` to **"evocative,
  non-photorealistic"** so it blends with a non-dreamlike preset (cinematic/realistic = filmic /
  painterly-realistic) while keeping the §8.2 **never-a-photoreal-likeness** guarantee — applied to **every**
  prompt regardless of preset; the name-free / no-private-field privacy boundary is unchanged (style notes are
  visual direction only, through the same distillation). **Added a reusable `textarea` settings control type**
  - a **grouped `select`** variant to the registry (`settings/types.ts` + `SettingField.tsx`; textarea reuses
    the design-system `Textarea`, renders full-width/stacked with a reset; **no new `/gallery` primitive** —
    `Textarea` is already catalogued). Code-reviewer **ship** (applied the one nit: the Settings grouped-select
    now renders a legacy/unknown value as a fallback option, matching the panel's §15.4 handling). Gate green:
    typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **340 core + 417 desktop + 8 relay** unit (+ prompt
    include/omit-direction-line + always-keeps-framing, a distillation-input capture asserting notes reach the
    Claude pass, textarea-persists + grouped-optgroups + legacy-fallback RTL, panel expanded-preset + legacy
    RTL), **59 E2E** (settings reveal sets an expanded preset + notes → both persist to `settings.json`;
    visualize stamps the chosen preset on `Dream.image.style`; 390px guard). **Visual QA** via the web preview
    at desktop + 390px (grouped Default-image-style select [4 families, 21 options], full-width style-notes
    textarea, the panel picker — 0 overflow, no console errors). On `feat/dream-image-style` off `main`; NOT
    merged (awaiting user confirm). **Lesson: one shared `IMAGE_STYLE_PRESETS` constant keeps a grouped picker
    identical across Settings and a feature panel — render it via native `<optgroup>` children (the design-system
    `Select` already takes children), and since the stored value is a free string, both surfaces must render a
    fallback `<option>` for an unlisted value or a controlled select silently shows the wrong one.**
- 2026-06-14 — Fix (**`budget:status` $-redaction — close the own-budget-$-over-IPC leak**; on `feat/shell-titlebar`,
  the package-E follow-up the code-reviewer flagged + the user asked to do now). The renderer already gated the $
  DISPLAY behind `budgets.manage`, but `budget:status` returned raw `spentUsd`/`limitUsd` to ALL callers (a
  non-admin could read their own spend over IPC via devtools). Now `BudgetState` always carries a **`budgetRatio`**
  (0..1, clamped; computed in core `checkBudget`) and `spentUsd`/`limitUsd` are **optional + bridge-redacted**:
  `budgetStatus` returns the dollars only to `budgets.manage` callers, a member gets `{state, budgetRatio, period}`
  for their own budget and a neutral `none` for the household **app** budget (the Everyone scope is admin-only too).
  The **UsageRing** now renders its % from `budgetRatio` + shows whenever `state !== 'none'` (was keyed on
  `limitUsd`), so it still works on redacted data; the admin $ line is guarded on `limitUsd != null`. Mirrors the
  established `usage:summary` / `usage:sessionCosts` redaction (memory `selfos-usage-budget-rules` updated: **the $
  boundary is the bridge, not the UI**). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **412 desktop**
  unit (+1 coreBridge: admin sees $, member gets ratio-only + no app $; UsageRing gains a redacted-status [ratio
  only, no $] render test), **59 E2E** (the member-bar-no-$ / admin-$ / usage-dashboard paths all still green).
  Updated 02 §13.4. **Lesson: a renderer display-gate is NOT a trust boundary — any cost/$ field must be redacted
  in the bridge for non-`budgets.manage` callers (return a `budgetRatio`, never the dollars), or it leaks over IPC.**
- 2026-06-14 — Build (**App-refresh package E — shell, TopBar & usage visibility; SPEC 02 §13 BUILT + Approved**;
  [02-app-shell](docs/specs/02-app-shell.md) §13, amends §3.4/§3.5; references 06). Replaced the in-content
  **TopBar** strip + the sidebar brand header with **ONE window-spanning `AppHeader` titlebar** (brand left,
  global controls right, sidebar+content below) — fixing the macOS brand-vs-traffic-lights collision and putting
  brand + controls in one cohesive bar. **Asked first** the 2 unstated UX forks (both confirmed): the **sync chip
  opens the vault folder** on click + the in-content **Banner stays**; the **brand links Home**. **Renderer:** a
  shared **`TitlebarControl`** primitive (one `--control-height`/hit-area/hover/focus, `no-drag`; → `/gallery`)
  that the appearance menu, usage ring, account menu + the new **`SyncStatusChip`** all render through, so the
  cluster (sync · usage · appearance · account) aligns exactly; the **enriched UsageRing dropdown** (% allowance,
  session count, **top usage by type**, **admin-only $ + AdminOnlyBadge**, "View usage details →"); `Brand` is now
  **presentational** + an `AppHeader` `Link` wrapper (so the lock screen still uses it inert), collapsing to a
  **tile-only mark below `--bp-sm`**; the mobile hamburger moved into the titlebar; **`AppShell`** restructured to
  header-over-(sidebar+content). **NO breadcrumb, NO global new-session button** (§13.6). **Main (`window.ts`):**
  **per-platform window chrome** — macOS keeps `hiddenInset` + a centered **`trafficLightPosition`** + a reserved
  **`--titlebar-traffic-width`** inset before the brand (**fullscreen reclaim** via a new **`window:fullscreenChanged`**
  event, pushed once on load for OS-restored-fullscreen); **Windows `titleBarOverlay`** + **Linux default-frame**
  are **blind/best-effort** (verified on-device later, like iOS). **Seam:** added `readonly platform: AppPlatform`
  - `onFullscreenChanged()` to `SelfosBridge`, threaded through preload (`process.platform`), coreBridge + webHost
    (Capacitor → `'ios'`/`'web'`), the Electron `ipc.ts` host, the coreBridge-test host, and the test-utils mock.
    New tokens `--titlebar-height`/`--titlebar-traffic-width`/`--titlebar-window-controls-width`/`--control-height`.
    Code-reviewer **fix-first** (applied both should-fixes: the **calm "all synced" chip label now names its action**
    since it's a button that opens the folder; **initial fullscreen state is pushed once on `did-finish-load`** so an
    OS-restored-fullscreen window doesn't reserve a dead 80px inset; deferred the pre-existing `budget:status`
    own-$-to-non-admin-over-IPC redaction as a follow-up task — display is already gated). Gate green: typecheck
  (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **411 desktop unit** (+10: TitlebarControl [3], SyncStatusChip [3], AppHeader
  [3], UsageRing admin-$/top-types [1]; updated Brand [now presentational/Router-free]), **59 E2E** (+2: the macOS
    traffic-light inset measured [brand left ≥72px, skipped off-darwin] + the usage dropdown → /usage; the brand
    collapses to tile-only at 390px; the geometry guard now covers the **whole** sync · usage · appearance · account
    cluster). **Visual QA**: the web preview at desktop (light+dark) + 390px (tile-only brand, sync chip collapsed,
    enriched dropdown with admin-$ + "Top usage", no overflow, no console errors) **and a real macOS Electron window
    capture** confirming the reserved traffic-light gap clears the brand. Deleted the old `TopBar`. On
    `feat/shell-titlebar` off `main`; NOT merged (awaiting user confirm). **Lesson: the brand's accessible name
    must NOT contain a word another control uses — "SelfOS, Home" collided with every `getByRole('link',{name:'Home'})`
    in the suite (Playwright substring-matches aria-labels), and the sync chip's "Vault: …" label collided with the
    Settings "Vault" button; name the brand link just "SelfOS" (title="Home") and scope colliding queries with
    `{exact:true}`. Also: on macOS the 80px traffic-light inset + a full control cluster overflows at phone width —
    the sync chip + brand wordmark must collapse first (§13.5 order), and platform-native window chrome (traffic
    lights) isn't in a Playwright page capture, so verify the inset by geometry + a real-window screenshot.** **NEXT:

- 2026-06-14 — Build (**App-refresh package D — questionnaire authoring UX; SPEC 08 §15 BUILT**;
  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §15, amends §3.1/§3.6/§13.3). Renderer-heavy authoring
  refinements, **no new capabilities/IPC channels** (one IPC **field removal**). All four items: (1) a **General**
  type added to the starter taxonomy + made the **default for new questionnaires**; (2) **sensitivity is
  intimacy/scenario-only** via a new pure single-source-of-truth module `questionnaireTypes.ts` (`SENSITIVITY_TYPES`):
  **intimacy** shows the tiers only (no Standard, seeds `intimacyGeneral`), **scenario** shows Standard default +
  escalatable tiers, **every other type hides the picker and forces `standard`** — `effectiveSensitivity(type,tier)`
  clamps on display **and on save** (so a stale/seeded non-standard tier on a non-sensitivity type or existing
  questionnaire can't leak), `seedSensitivityForType` (a delegate of the same clamp) reseeds on type-change/custom-type-add;
  the `.metaRow[data-cols]` grid collapses Type to full-width when the picker is hidden; (3) **reworded the
  compatibility "who sees what" copy** — dropped "break-glass"/"audited" jargon, "Each sees their own" →
  **"Shared report + your own answers"**, plus a plain **"A record is kept each time you open their answers"** line for
  `senderSeesAll` (the `readRaw` + audit mechanism is **unchanged**); light pass on core `disclosure.ts` ("shared
  compatibility report" → "combined report"); (4) **removed the "Use my information" AI toggle** — author context is
  always used, so `includeAuthor` was **dropped from the renderer-facing `questionnairesGenerate` IPC** (channels +
  `GenerateSchema`) and **hardcoded `true` in `coreBridge`**, while the **core context-provider registry KEEPS
  `includeAuthor`** (compatibility/target-context legitimately passes `false` — the §13.3 shareable-only boundary is
  intact); (5) a **live inline per-question preview** (`QuestionPreview.tsx`) reusing the shared **`@selfos/answering`**
  `QuestionnaireForm` — byte-identical to the recipient view, **expanded for the focused question, collapsed for the
  rest** (`onFocusCapture` sets the open id; per-card "Show/Hide preview" toggle), non-interactive (local throwaway
  answers), crisis footer suppressed inline (the full Preview mode still shows it). Code-reviewer **ship** (sensitivity
  clamp airtight on save + existing/seeded questionnaires; the `includeAuthor` IPC narrowing keeps the author-always /
  target-optional boundary; the inline toggle's `aria-label="Show/Hide preview"` overrides its visible "Preview" text so
  it never collides with the mode "Preview" button — fixed the 3 E2E mode clicks to `{exact:true}`; applied the DRY nit
  — `seedSensitivityForType` now delegates to `effectiveSensitivity`). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint,
  format, **336 core + 402 desktop + 8 relay** unit (+`questionnaireTypes` [6], +6 RTL §15, updated the compat-label +
  sensitive-note tests), **57 E2E** (+1: General default [no picker] → inline rating preview matches full Preview →
  Intimacy tiers + note → save/reopen round-trip + 390px inner-scrollbar guard). **Visual QA** via the web preview at
  390px (General full-width Type/no picker, Intimacy tiers + consent note, inline preview live-updating shortText→Yes/No,
  reworded visibility copy — 0 overflow, no console errors). **Deferred (captured in §15.8):** "break-glass" still
  appears in `RelaySendPanel` + the admin disclosure setting (out of §15.3 scope — a future light copy pass). On
  `feat/questionnaire-authoring-ux` off `main`; NOT merged (awaiting user confirm). **Lesson: when a build serves a
  prebuilt `dist-web` (hashed assets) rather than live `/src`, source edits won't appear in the web preview until you
  re-run `build:web` — and the inline-preview reuse of `@selfos/answering` duplicates a question's accessible elements
  (img alt, "Preview"), so scope E2E queries (`.first()`, `{exact:true}`) accordingly.**
- 2026-06-14 — Polish round 2 + **rules update** (user: "wrapping is LAZY, not design; cards waste vertical
  space"). Replaced the wrapping pill-chip status filter with a **full-width `Select`** (fills the sidebar,
  scales to any label, never wraps — `combobox` "Filter sessions by status"); **redesigned the guided cards
  to be compact** (~5 lines → ~3: tight padding, a single eyebrow row carrying the framework tag + a "Steps"
  marker, a **2-line-clamped blurb**, a hover go-arrow, and a denser `auto-fit` minmax(190px) grid that
  fills the row). Rules updated: CLAUDE.md §12 + memory `selfos-ui-conventions` now say **don't solve
  "doesn't fit" by wrapping a control row — use a space-filling component (full-width `Select`/control)** and
  **design cards for density** (clamp blurbs, fold metadata, denser grid). E2E updated for the Select filter
  (`selectOption` instead of clicking chips) and status assertions target the pill's `data-status` (not the
  text, which now also matches the hidden `<option>`). Gate green: typecheck/lint/format, 336 core + 389
  desktop unit, **56 E2E**. Visual QA at 390/900/1280px (full-width Select, 3-up compact cards at desktop /
  1-up at phone, no scrollbars, no console errors). **Lesson: when a control row doesn't fit, the answer is a
  different COMPONENT (a Select that fills the space), never `flex-wrap` — and a text assertion like
  `getByText('In progress')` silently starts matching a `<select>`'s hidden `<option>` once you swap to a
  Select, so assert status pills by a stable hook (`[data-status]`), not their label text.**
- 2026-06-14 — Polish + **rules update** (Sessions launcher UI/UX pass; user flagged avoidable flaws). Fixed:
  (1) the status filter was a `SegmentedControl` that **scrolled-x** in the narrow sidebar → replaced with
  **wrapping pill chips** (no scrollbar); (2) guided-session cards put the title + framework tag on one line
  → title wrapped a word-per-line at narrow widths → **tag is now an eyebrow ABOVE a full-width title**;
  (3) the Intimacy accordion butted its content against the title → **`details[open]` summary margin-bottom**;
  (4) a **pre-existing flexbox bug** — the conversation title lacked `min-width:0` so it overflowed the sidebar
  (horizontal scrollbar) → fixed; (5) the row crammed 3 pills + 3 action icons → **rename/delete collapsed into
  the kebab menu**, leaving one clean `⋯` (also fixed a real **dropdown-clipping** bug: the wrapped lone kebab
  went left-aligned and its `right:0` menu rendered off the sidebar's edge where `overflow` clipped it). **Rules
  updated** per the user: CLAUDE.md **§12** (no horizontal scrollbars anywhere incl. inner controls; title never
  shares a line with a tag; flex `min-width:0`; dropdowns not clipped; accordion spacing) + **§7 DoD** (the E2E
  overflow guard must catch INNER scrollbars — assert no element has `scrollWidth>clientWidth` with
  `overflow-x:auto|scroll` — and test at the ACTUAL container widths, e.g. the ~240px sidebar, not just 390px);
  memory `selfos-ui-conventions` synced. The guided E2E now asserts **no inner scrollbar at 390px AND 900px**;
  session kebab E2E interactions **scoped to the Conversations sidebar** (fixes a flaky race where the thread-head
  kebab — which has no Rename — was grabbed by `.first()` before the sidebar row rendered). Gate green:
  typecheck/lint/format, 336 core + 389 desktop unit, **56 E2E** (incl. 5 session tests ×2 for flakiness). Visual
  QA at desktop + 390px (filter chips wrap, eyebrow-tag cards, decluttered rows, no scrollbars, no console
  errors). **Lesson: a `main`-only overflow guard misses inner scrollbars (a scrolling SegmentedControl) and
  pane-specific overflow (a `min-width:0`-less flex title) — the guard must scan ALL elements for
  `overflow-x:auto|scroll` + `scrollWidth>clientWidth` and run at the real narrow container widths; and a
  `right:0` dropdown whose trigger can wrap to a left-aligned line will render off-screen and get clipped.**

  [16-guided-sessions](docs/specs/16-guided-sessions.md), builds on `05`/`06`/`09`/`08`/`04`). The Sessions start

  - a grouped curated **catalog** (Reflective & therapy-informed · Coaching · Intimacy & connection). A guided

    unspecced build forks (all confirmed): suggestions are **explicit-first-tap** (no silent spend — `guided:getState`
    reads the cache, `guided:suggest` spends `guided.suggest`); structured steps advance via an **AI-embedded
    `[[SELFOS:STEP:n]]` marker** (turn-free, stripped from saved + streamed text, clamped, best-effort — never blocks
    free input, mirroring the `09` wrap-up marker); the **18+ intimacy ack is per-person in the vault**
    (`people/<id>/guidance/prefs.enc`, reset on switch). **Core:** `guidedCatalog.ts` (17 built-in exercises, code not
    vault; **non-clinical group titles + per-card framework tags**; every addendum + opener leads with "self-help
    inspired by X, **not therapy**"); `guidedSteps.ts`; `buildSystemPrompt(…, guideId?)` appends the addendum

    gap-finder context-provider registry** — structured context only, **never transcripts** — + cache + ack);
    `endAndSummarize` notes the exercise (`provenance.guideId` + a leading "Exercise: …" fact). **Schema:**
    additive-optional `Conversation.guideId`/`guideStep` + `InsightProvenance.guideId` (**no schemaVersion bump/
    migration**); `Guided*` cache/prefs/view schemas; `guided.suggest` usage type. **Seam:** `sessions:startGuided` /
    `guided:getState` / `guided:suggest` / `guided:acknowledgeAdult` — gated `sessions.own` + active-person-scoped
    **in the bridge** (the trust boundary; intimacy is excluded from suggestions host-side until acked, not just in
    the UI); the Claude call + key stay in main. **Renderer:** the launcher (free-start composer + `SuggestedSessions`
    explicit-first-tap row with calm AI-off/over-budget/thin-profile states + grouped collapsible `GuidedCatalog`
    with the per-person-gated Intimacy group), `GuidedStepper` beside structured threads, `guidanceStore` (per-person,
    reset in AppShell), `conversationStore` guide fields + `startGuided`; `/gallery` gains the card + stepper.

  session); status is set from a **per-row kebab**; the AI completion suggestion **re-surfaces on a later hint**
  after dismiss. **Schema:** `Conversation.status` (`inProgress`/`onHold`/`complete`) + `endedAt`/`insightId`/
  `insightStale` — all **additive-optional, NO schemaVersion bump** (reconciled the spec's draft "bump+migration"
  to the dream/person additive precedent; `conversationStatus(c)` normalizes absent ⇒ `inProgress`); `wrapUpSuggested?`
  on `ChatTurnResult`; `SessionSummaryResult`/`SessionCost` view types; `session.analyze` usage type. **Core:**
  `sessionAnalysisService` — `endAndSummarize` reads the transcript ONCE in the subject's own process → an
  auto-approved `Insight` (`source:'session'`, mood metrics `moodValence`/`moodEnergy` clamped −1..1, facts =
  Theme/Goal/Follow-up/Person-mentioned), **meters BEFORE parse** (a failed-parse paid call is still billed),
  and the **re-run/stale path reuses the insightId + carries each fact's `shareableWith` forward by text**;
  `setSessionStatus`; `rollupSessionCosts`. The **`wrapUpSuggested` hint is turn-embedded** (no extra Claude
  call): the coach may append a private `[[SELFOS:WRAPUP]]` marker that `chatService` strips from BOTH the saved
  - streamed text (`stripWrapUpMarker`, partial-marker-safe), and **continuing a `complete` session flips it back
    to `inProgress` + marks the insight stale**. Session Insights flow through the **existing** shared insight
    provider, so the gap-finder + Memory surface pick them up with no new plumbing. **Bridge (trust boundary):**
    `sessions:setStatus`/`:endAndSummarize` gated by `sessions.own` + active-person-scoped; `usage:sessionCosts`
    returns per-session `{tokens, costUsd?, budgetRatio}` where **`costUsd` is included ONLY for `budgets.manage`
    admins** (redacted in the bridge, mirroring `usage:summary`) — everyone else gets a dollar-free `budgetRatio`.
    **Settings:** a new **Sessions** section with `sessions.memoryEnabled` (default ON — the master memory toggle)
  - `sessions.autoSummarizeOnEnd` (default OFF — completing **asks** before spending; declining still completes).
    **Renderer:** status pills + an All/In-progress/On-hold/Complete filter, the per-row kebab status setter, a
    per-session cost indicator (admin `$`+`AdminOnlyBadge` else a budget bar), the inline `WrapUpCard`
    (crisis-first if flagged, mood chips, facts, Memory link) + the dismissible `WrapUpSuggestion` chip near the
    composer. Code-reviewer **ship** (privacy boundary + admin-$ redaction verified airtight; metering-before-parse,
    re-run carry-forward, marker-never-persisted-or-shown all confirmed; applied both should-fixes — **every
    summarize affordance is now gated on `sessions.memoryEnabled` so memory-off never offers a button that can only
    fail, and the kebab "Complete & summarize" is hidden on an already-complete session** so it can't silently
    re-spend — and the nit: wired the discarded `people` field into Person-mentioned facts). `sessions:reanalyze`
    folded into `endAndSummarize` (the re-run path is the same call when an insight already exists — no redundant
    seam). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **308 core + 382 desktop + 8 relay** unit (+
    sessionAnalysisService [13], wrapUp [3], chatService marker/reopen [3], bridge admin-$/memory-off/gating [4],
  Sessions RTL [5], sessions-settings [3]), **+2 E2E** (complete→summarize→**decrypt the real `buildContext` and
  assert the goal feeds a later session** + filter + reopen-flips; member sees the bar with **no $** + memory-off
  offers no summarize affordance + no Insight). **Visual QA** via the web preview at 571px + 390px (status pills,
  admin-$ badge, kebab menu, wrap-up card all clean; 0 overflow, no console errors). On `feat/session-analysis`
    off `main`. **Lesson: a turn-embedded `wrapUpSuggested` hint (a private marker the coach may append, stripped
    from saved + streamed text) gets an AI completion signal for FREE on the turn the user already paid for — no
    second call — but every UI affordance that would SPEND on the back of it (summarize) must be gated on BOTH AI
    config AND the memory toggle, or you ship a button whose only outcome is a calm error.** **NEXT package: C
    (`16-guided-sessions`) — leans on B.**
- 2026-06-14 — Build (**App-refresh package A — the unified shareability model; SPEC 15 FULLY BUILT**;
  [15-shareability](docs/specs/15-shareability.md), amends `04`/`12`/`13`). Replaced People's fixed
  shareable/private buckets AND Dreams' silent "sensitive = excluded" with **one per-item control**. **Asked
  first** the two unspecced UX forks (both confirmed): `pronouns`/`birthday` get inline `ShareToggle`s on the
  Profile tab too, and ONE "Share all / Lock all" lives in the About header flipping **every** controllable
  field. **Schema:** `Person.privateFields` (opt-out list of locked field keys; absent ⇒ shared) +
  `PersonFieldKeySchema`/`PERSON_FIELD_KEYS` + the single gate `isPersonFieldShared`; **merged**
  `publicNotes`+`privateNotes` → one `notes` on **both Person AND Relationship** (+ `Relationship.notesShared`)
  — the **one schemaVersion bump** (v1→v2) with an **idempotent read-time migration**
  (`people/migrations.ts`, wired into `getPerson`/`listRelationships`); `Dream.informsContext` (default on)
  replacing the sensitivity exclusion. **Default = everything shared, literal flip, no grandfathering**
  (pre-release). **Core:** `buildContext` refactored to `profileLines(person, audience)` (own = all fields;
  others = only `isPersonFieldShared`); `buildDepictionNote` gates **each** depiction part (so a locked
  appearance/gender/ethnicity/birthday is withheld from the image too); **`insightFeedsContext`**
  (insights/insightStore) suppresses a **dream-sourced insight from ALL context** when its dream's
  `informsContext` is off — reads the dream file **directly** to dodge the insights↔dreams cycle (the
  `listAllInsights` precedent), **fail-closed** on a malformed dream (§7 "not silently shared"); health/faith
  - relationship notes + questionnaire `contextProviders` all moved onto the per-field gate;
    `dreamInsightService` dropped the SENSITIVE guard (sensitive dreams now shareable when `informsContext` on).
    **Renderer:** a new **`ShareToggle`** primitive (icon + text, `aria-pressed`, state-as-text — added to
    `/gallery`); a `Field.labelAction` slot; `PersonEditor` per-field toggles + bulk Share/Lock-all + merged
    Notes + dissolved About/Private split; `RelationshipsEditor` merged Notes + share toggle; `DreamComposer`
    informsContext switch + revised sensitivity help; `DreamAnalysisPane` gates share controls on
    `informsContext` (not tier). Code-reviewer **ship** (privacy invariant verified airtight on **every** traced
    path; migration idempotent + lossless; cycle-free gate; applied both nits — future-proofed the relationship
    notes-save to not drop `closeness`/`since`/`label`, and made the malformed-dream gate fail-closed). Gate
    green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **289 core + 370 desktop + 8 relay** unit (+ the §10
    per-key privacy-boundary truth table, the notes-merge migration [person+relationship], `informsContext`
    on/off exclusion, sensitive-now-shares, `ShareToggle` RTL, PersonEditor toggle/Lock-all/removed-copy,
    DreamComposer switch), **+1 E2E** (UI-driven lock of `healthNotes` on a related person → **decrypt the real
    assembled `buildContext` and assert the locked note is ABSENT while a shared field is PRESENT** + an
    informsContext round-trip + a 390px About-editor overflow guard). **Visual QA** via the web preview at
    desktop + 390px (toggles end-aligned with labels, Share/Lock-all in the header, the §3.1 inline explainer,
    Lock-all → Private state distinct by icon+text not colour, merged Notes, the dream switch + revised
    sensitivity help; 0 overflow, no console errors). Synced the amended specs (`04` §3.4/§4.1/§4.2/§8, `12`
    §3.1/§3.4/§8.3, `13` §3.7/§4.6/§8.2) to cross-reference 15. On `feat/shareability` off `main`. **Lesson: a
    ShareToggle's accessible name containing "may inform PEOPLE you relate to" collides with Playwright's
    substring `getByRole('button', {name:'People'})` and `getByLabel('Occupation')` (Playwright matches
    aria-label substrings; Testing-Library getByLabelText doesn't) — use `{exact:true}` on label/role matchers
    that share a word with a toggle's verbose accessible name.** **Package A is the foundational privacy refactor
    the rest of the 2026-06 refresh (B–G) builds on.**
- 2026-06-14 — Build (**Vault relinking slice 3 — the VaultError "Use a different vault" affordance; SPEC 14
  IS NOW FULLY BUILT**; [14-vault-relinking](docs/specs/14-vault-relinking.md) §7.7/§13 slice 3). The boot
  **VaultError** screen's second action changed from a direct `chooseVault()` ("Choose a different folder") to
  an **unlink-backed "Use a different vault"** (`appStore.unlink()`) — **fixing a latent stale-key bug**: the
  old path re-pointed via `useVault(newPath)` while the previous vault's master key was still on the device, so
  switching to a _different_ vault would have desync'd (fresh folder → UnlockScreen dead-end) or hit wrong-key
  decrypt failures. Routing through `unlink` clears the key + pointer first → onboarding "Choose a folder", so
  the switch is **key-safe**. **Retry is unchanged** (re-checks the SAME folder; the key is still valid for a
  temporarily-offline vault, so it must NOT unlink). **Visual-QA caught a real responsive bug** the 390px guard
  then locked: a long absolute vault path in the error message didn't wrap → horizontal overflow at phone
  width; fixed with `overflow-wrap: anywhere` on the description (the preview missed it because it used a short
  bookmark — the E2E's real tmpdir path surfaced it). Code-reviewer **ship** (the unlink-vs-refresh split
  verified; `unlink` is key-safe on an unreachable vault since it touches no vault bytes; applied the one nit —
  the spec-named 390px guard, which then found the overflow). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint,
  format, **269 core + 361 desktop** unit (+3 `VaultError` RTL: renders both actions, Retry→refresh-not-unlink,
  the new button→unlink), **+1 E2E** (boot to VaultError on a missing path → "Use a different vault" →
  onboarding + device pointer cleared + a 390px overflow guard). **Visual QA** of the VaultError screen at
  desktop + 390px via the web preview (clean, buttons aligned; the web path clears `vaultBookmark` → onboarding
  with no console errors). On `feat/vault-relinking-slice-3` off `main`. **Lesson: a vault path is a long
  unbreakable string — any UI that renders it must `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, and a 390px guard that uses a
  REAL (long) path catches it where a short fixture wouldn't.** **Spec 14 (vault relinking) is COMPLETE — all 3
  slices on `main`: the `vault:unlink` backend op + seam (1), the Settings "Change vault…" control + dialog +
  cross-platform `vaultBookmark` clearing (2), and the VaultError affordance (3). Users can now unlink the
  current vault and switch to a different one, from Settings or the error screen, on both Electron and web/iOS,
  with no data loss and a key-safe re-link.**
- 2026-06-14 — Build (**Vault relinking slice 2 — the Settings "Change vault…" control + dialog + route-back**;
  [14-vault-relinking](docs/specs/14-vault-relinking.md) §3/§5.3/§5.4/§13 slice 2). The first user-facing
  surface: a **`vault.change`** custom row in Settings → Vault (no admin gate — any signed-in person, decision
  #3) opening a hand-rolled **`ChangeVaultDialog`** (`role="dialog"`, mirrors LockScreen/SuperAdminUnlock — no
  new design-system primitive, decision #6; Esc/scrim/Cancel = no-op, `aria-busy` on Continue, calm danger
  Banner on failure). On Continue → **`appStore.unlink()`**: calls `unlinkVault()`, resets `sessionStore`
  (new `reset()`) + **every** per-person store (the AppShell list **+ `resultsStore`**), then `apply(boot)` →
  onboarding; the Shell unmounts and the existing "Choose a folder" + `HouseholdGate` take over (no new
  routing). **Cross-platform fix found in visual QA:** the web/iOS host keys the active vault on
  **`vaultBookmark`**, not `vaultPath`, so the factory now clears **both** pointers — added a sound
  **`DeviceStatePatch`** type (lets the optional `vaultBookmark` be cleared to `undefined`; required-nullable
  `vaultPath` still takes `null`) threaded through `BridgeHost.updateDeviceState` + the node & web device
  stores. **Also closed a pre-existing gap:** `resultsStore` (sender-scoped Results/trends) now resets on an
  active-person switch in `AppShell` too. Code-reviewer **ship** (master key still cleared first, no vault
  bytes touched, API keys preserved, no import cycle, `DeviceStatePatch` sound; applied both should-fixes —
  `aria-busy` + the `resultsStore` AppShell reset — and the web-host clear test). Gate green: typecheck (node +
  web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **269 core + 358 desktop** unit (+`appStore` unlink/rethrow, +`ChangeVaultDialog`
  6, +`customRows` 1, +`webStores` vaultBookmark-clear, +bridge vaultBookmark assertion), **+1 E2E** (Settings →
  Change vault → Continue → onboarding; vault A `recovery.enc` **byte-identical** + device pointer cleared +
  **re-linkable** via the recovery-phrase UnlockScreen; a 390px dialog overflow guard). **Visual QA** via the
  web preview at desktop + 390px (the dialog reads calm/reversible — bold-led points, the amber recovery-phrase
  caveat, bottom-aligned Continue/Cancel; the new Settings row sits cohesively under Location/Reveal; the full
  web flow Change vault → onboarding verified end-to-end with no console errors — proving the iOS/web host gets
  unlink via the shared factory). On `feat/vault-relinking-slice-2` off `main`. **Lesson: the active-vault
  pointer is platform-specific — Electron `vaultPath` vs web/iOS `vaultBookmark` — so any detach must clear
  BOTH; a fix that only cleared `vaultPath` left the web/iOS app stuck (key gone but bookmark present).**
  **NEXT: slice 3** — the VaultError "Use a different vault" affordance (unlink-backed, key-safe; fixes the
  latent stale-key bug in that screen's "Choose a different folder").
- 2026-06-14 — Build (**Vault relinking slice 1 — the `vault:unlink` backend op + IPC seam**;
  [14-vault-relinking](docs/specs/14-vault-relinking.md) §5/§6/§13 slice 1). The first slice of the approved
  spec 14 (let users unlink the current vault folder + select a different one). **Backend only, no UI** — the
  Settings "Change vault…" control + dialog (slice 2) and the VaultError "Use a different vault" affordance
  (slice 3) follow. New `vault:unlink` op through the full typed seam (`channels.ts` `IpcChannels.unlinkVault =
'vault:unlink'` + `SelfosBridge.unlinkVault(): Promise<BootState>` → **`coreBridge.ts` host-agnostic detach**
  → **`ipc.ts` platform wrapper** → preload → `test-utils/bridge` mock). The detach (host-agnostic half):
  **clear the single-slot master key FIRST** (`secrets.clear(MASTER_KEY_ID)`) → clear device-local
  `vaultPath`/`activePersonId`/`pendingJoinPersonId` → reset super-admin inspect → `refreshBootState()` →
  onboarding. **Touches NO vault bytes** (the folder stays byte-intact + re-linkable via its recovery phrase).
  The watcher-stop (`stopVaultWatcher()`) is the platform wrapper in `ipc.ts`, exactly mirroring `useVault`'s
  `startVaultWatcher` (iOS has no chokidar → that step is a no-op; the shared factory is correct for both).
  Improved the shared `coreBridge.test` host so `getBootState`/`refreshBootState` derive from `device.vaultPath`
  (like the real `computeBootState`), so unlink recomputes to onboarding in tests instead of a frozen `ready`.
  Code-reviewer verdict **ship** (detach order + clear-key-first safety verified; key never crosses IPC; no
  vault writer invoked; typed seam complete across all 5 layers; applied the one nit — a partial-failure
  ordering test). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **348 desktop + 269 core** unit (+4
  bridge: detach-clears-everything, vault-byte-untouched, idempotent-when-detached, clear-key-before-write-
  failure-stays-recoverable). On `feat/vault-relinking-slice-1` off `main`. **Why clear the key:** it's a single
  device slot, not keyed per vault — a stale key would mis-route the next folder (fresh → desync UnlockScreen;
  different existing vault → wrong-key decrypt failures, §7.1). Clearing it lets the existing `HouseholdGate`
  route the next folder with zero new routing code — which is why **unlink == switch**. **NEXT: slice 2** — the
  Settings "Change vault…" control + hand-rolled confirmation dialog + renderer store-reset/route-back + RTL +
  the full switch-round-trip E2E + visual QA.
- 2026-06-12 — Build (**Dream-images slice 5 — export + per-dream image sharing; SPEC 13 IS NOW FULLY BUILT**;
  [13-dream-images](docs/specs/13-dream-images.md) §3.5/§3.6/§13.1 slice 5). The final slice. **Asked first**
  the §11.4 placement: the recipient's **"Shared with you"** lives as a **section at the top of the Dreams
  journal** (self-hides when empty). **Export:** `dreams:exportImage` decrypts the image and a new
  **`saveImageFile` platform host op** writes the bytes **OUTSIDE the encrypted vault** (Electron save dialog +
  `writeFile`, with a `SELFOS_FAKE_SAVE_DIR` E2E hook; a Blob download on web/iOS); gated `dreams.generateImage`,
  dreamer-scoped; the panel's "Save image…" shows a "leaves the encrypted vault" note. **Sharing (mirrors the
  `12` §13.5 fact-share):** core `setDreamImageShare` (toggle `Dream.image.shareableWith`; refuses sensitive +
  non-related target), `getSharedDreamImage` + `listImagesSharedWith` with the **read-time re-gate** — both
  re-validate relationship + `shareableWith` + standard-tier on **every read**, so **un-share OR removed
  relationship OR a sensitive tier denies with no stale access** (no `shareableWith` cleanup needed —
  `listRelatedPeople` is the symmetric gate). Seam: `dreams:setImageShare` (gated **`dreams.shareContext`**,
  dreamer-scoped — a recipient can't re-share another's image) / `:getSharedImage` / `:listSharedImages`
  (viewer-scoped — the share itself is the grant). Renderer: the `DreamImagePanel`'s **Save image…** + **Share**
  controls (a per-related-person `Switch` list; shown only standard-tier + `dreams.shareContext` + has
  relations; a "kept out of shared context" note otherwise), and the recipient's **`SharedDreamImages`** gallery
  at the top of Dreams. **Also fixed a pre-existing per-person leak** the 390px QA surfaced: `Dreams.tsx` now
  **resets its `selection` on `activePersonId` change** — a switch had left another person's dream selected,
  hiding the mobile list (incl. "Shared with you"). Images still **never feed AI coaching context** — sharing
  only makes them viewable. Code-reviewer **ship** (the read-time re-gate verified airtight on every path —
  no path lets a non-recipient read another's image; export writes a decrypted file only by the dreamer's
  gated action; sharing scoped to `dreams.shareContext` + the active person; two optional nits, no change).
  Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **269 core + 344 desktop + 8 relay** unit (+3 core
  sharing [share→read→un-share-denies, relationship-removal-denies, sensitive+non-related-refused], +1 bridge
  export→share→recipient round-trip, +4 RTL), **+1 E2E** (`SELFOS_FAKE_IMAGE`+`SELFOS_FAKE_SAVE_DIR`: export
  writes a **real PNG outside the vault** [magic-byte assert — decrypted, not ciphertext] + share → switch to
  the partner → the image appears in their "Shared with you"). Visual QA at desktop + 390px (the Share controls
  - cost/Admin-only badge + the recipient gallery all read clean; the per-person reset fixed the mobile
    recipient view). Built in the **`feat/dream-images-slice-5`** worktree off `main`. **Lesson: a per-person
    read-time re-gate (relationship + share + sensitivity re-checked on EVERY read) means a share auto-revokes
    when any of those changes — no separate revocation or `shareableWith` cleanup is needed, and a removed
    relationship drops the share for free.** **Spec 13 (AI dream images) is COMPLETE — all 5 slices on `main`;
    the People-profile descriptive fields, the OpenAI second provider, generation, metering, settings, the
    capability, the panel, export, and per-dream sharing are all built + tested. The only remaining Dreams work
    is the user's real on-device OpenAI/Cloudflare verification (blind-written like the relay/iOS bits).**
- 2026-06-12 — Build (**Dream-images slice 4 — the `DreamImagePanel` renderer + generate E2E**;
  [13-dream-images](docs/specs/13-dream-images.md) §3/§13.1 slice 4). The user-facing surface: a shared
  **`DreamImagePanel`** rendered in BOTH the dream detail/composer (`DreamComposer`, on a saved dream) and the
  analysis card (`DreamAnalysisPane`, beside the synthesis), bound to the dream id. **Self-contained local
  state + a `reqId` request-guard** (chose this over threading image state through the stores — per-person
  isolation already holds because the panel remounts per dream and `dreamStore.reset()` fires on a person
  switch; the reviewer verified no path renders one dream's bytes under another). **States** (resolved in
  priority order, no dead controls): capability-absent → **hidden** (`!can('dreams.generateImage')` → null,
  the bridge stays the trust boundary); calm consent-off / AI-off / no-key → a Settings link; entry (style
  picker + "Visualize this dream"); the **sensitive-tier warning-before-send** (any non-standard tier confirms
  before any provider call); loading; success (the `<img>` from a base64 data URL + Regenerate + "Delete
  image" + **admin-only cost**); REFUSED/BUDGET/ERROR calm messages; triggers hide while a confirm is open.
  **Admin-only cost double-gated:** a new admin-gated `costUsd` on `DreamImageResult` (the bridge includes it
  only when the active person can `budgets.manage`) AND the panel only renders it when `isAdmin` — a non-admin
  never sees a $ figure. `Dreams.module.css` gained `.imagePanel` + a square `.dreamImage` (max-width 420,
  object-fit cover). Code-reviewer **fix-first** (applied the one should-fix: the no-key calm state flashed for
  a frame before the async `secretHas` resolved on the happy path → now gated on `!loading && !hasKey`; the
  per-dream/person isolation, the double-gated cost, the capability boundary, the sensitive-tier warning, and
  a11y [meaningful `<img>` alt — never the raw prompt; `aria-live` loading; cost text equivalent] all verified
  clean). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **266 core + 339 desktop + 8 relay** unit
  (+8 RTL: every calm state, generate+cost, sensitive warning, existing-image+delete, refusal), **+1 E2E**
  (`SELFOS_FAKE_IMAGE`+`SELFOS_FAKE_CLAUDE`: a sensitive dream → warning → generate → **assert `image.enc` is
  an AES-GCM envelope on disk, not the raw PNG** → regenerate → delete → image.enc gone). Visual QA at desktop
  - 390px (the panel sits below the dream fields / beside the analysis card; square image, clean Regenerate/
    Delete actions; no overflow). Built in the **`feat/dream-images-slice-4`** worktree off `main`. **Lesson: a
    panel whose readiness depends on an ASYNC check (`secretHas`) must gate that calm state on the initial load
    completing (`!loading && !hasKey`) — otherwise the common happy path flashes the wrong "add a key" state for
    a frame before the check returns; `findBy*` RTL waits for the settled state, so it won't catch the flash.**
    **NEXT: slice 5 (the LAST) — export (`dreams:exportImage` save dialog, bytes leave the encrypted vault) +
    per-dream image sharing (`Dream.image.shareableWith` + `dreams:imageShareTargets`/`:setImageShare`/
    `:getSharedImage`, gated `dreams.shareContext`, sensitive-excluded, read-time re-gate) + the recipient's
    "Shared with you" surface (ASK the user where it lives) + export/share E2E.**
- 2026-06-12 — Build (**Dream-images slice 3 — IPC seam + settings + capability**;
  [13-dream-images](docs/specs/13-dream-images.md) §6/§13.1 slice 3). Wires slice 2's `dreamImageService`
  through the renderer-facing seam. New **`dreams.generateImage`** capability (Member default ON; **not**
  EXPLICIT_GRANT_ONLY, so the Owner auto-grants it; Guest denied). IPC `dreams:generateImage`/`:getImage`/
  `:deleteImage` through the full seam (`channels.ts` + the slim `DreamImageResult` → **`coreBridge.ts` (the
  trust boundary)** → `ipc.ts` thin delegates + `image: defaultImageClient()` host wiring → `preload` →
  `test-utils/bridge` mock), all **gated by `dreams.generateImage` + dreamer-scoped**, with **both API keys
  read host-side** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_ID` + `OPENAI_API_KEY_ID`) and **never crossing IPC**. `dreamGenerateImage`
  reads consent/model/style from vault settings and maps the rich result → the slim `DreamImageResult` (usage
  events stay host-side); `dreamGetImage` returns base64 (the `08` §13.2 pattern). **Settings** (Dreams
  section): `dreams.imageGenerationEnabled` (the one-time consent, default OFF), `dreams.imageModel`
  (**admin-only** `gpt-image-2`/`gpt-image-1` select), `dreams.imageStyle` (default-style select), and an
  **admin-only `OpenAiKeyControl`** — `aiControls.tsx` refactored to a shared **write-only `SecretKeyControl`**
  so the Claude + OpenAI key controls share one impl (secretSet/secretHas/secretClear, **never a get**);
  model/style/key `visibleWhen` consent on. The **`image` host part** added to `BridgeHost` — Electron uses
  `defaultImageClient`, the web preview `webFakeImageClient`, and iOS a new **`browserImageClient`**
  (browser-mode OpenAI `fetch`, the `browserClaudeClient` mirror, so iOS gets image-gen via `createCoreBridge`
  for free). Code-reviewer **ship** (trust boundary airtight — keys never returned; all 3 ops re-enforce the
  capability + scope in the bridge, not the UI; settings defaults match the service; `browserImageClient`
  line-for-line faithful to `openaiImageClient`; the `SecretKeyControl` refactor preserves `ApiKeyControl`'s
  exact behavior; two intentional nits noted, no change). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint,
  format, **266 core + 331 desktop + 8 relay** unit (+2 bridge: a consent/key/capability-gated
  generate→read→delete encrypted round-trip + a Guest denial; +1 RTL `OpenAiKeyControl` saves under the OpenAI
  id), **+1 E2E** (the dream-image settings reveal + the "Admin only" marker; the section-overflow + 390px
  responsive sweeps now also cover the new settings). Visual QA at desktop + 390px (the Dreams settings
  section: consent toggle → model [Admin only] + style + OpenAI key reveal cleanly, no overflow). Built in the
  **`feat/dream-images-slice-3`** worktree off `main`. **Lesson: a second provider's key control is just the
  same write-only `SecretKeyControl` parametrized by a different `SecretStore` id — secretSet/secretHas/
  secretClear are generic, so no new secret IPC is needed; the key is read host-side in the bridge and never
  returned to the renderer.** \*\*NEXT: slice 4 — the shared `DreamImagePanel` (dream detail/composer + analysis
  card) with the generate/loading/success/refusal/calm states + the sensitive-tier warning + Regenerate/Delete

  [13-dream-images](docs/specs/13-dream-images.md) §13.1 slice 2). SelfOS's **second AI provider** (OpenAI,
  images only — text stays Anthropic), core-only (no IPC/renderer — slice 3). **Asked first** the §11.1/§11.2
  build-time confirmations: ship **`gpt-image-2` (default) + `gpt-image-1`** at **~$0.17** flat. New
  **`ImageClient`** host interface (`@selfos/core/host`, the `ClaudeClient` mirror; a `REFUSED` [content-policy,
  uncharged] vs `ERROR` [transport] outcome) + a main-side **OpenAI impl + offline fake**
  (`apps/desktop/src/main/image/openaiImageClient.ts`, gated by `SELFOS_FAKE_IMAGE`; `=refuse` mode for the
  slice-4 refusal E2E; blind-written like the relay/iOS bits — user verifies on-device) +
  `OPENAI_API_KEY_ID = 'openai.apiKey'`. **The privacy core:** `buildDepictionNote` + `ageFromBirthday`
  (`@selfos/core/people`) is the single, **name-free + private-free** depiction source (appearance + gender +
  exact age from `birthday` + ethnicity; structurally never reads displayName/notes/private), and the pure
  `buildImagePromptInput` assembles the name-free distillation input. **Two-call flow** in
  `dreamImageService.generateDreamImage`: consent + both keys + budget gates → **Claude distillation** (records
  token `dream.imagePrompt`; the name-stripping pass) → **OpenAI render** → validate bytes/mime → `encryptBytes`
  → `people/<id>/dreams/<id>/image.enc` → stamp additive-optional `Dream.image` → record **flat** `dream.image`.
  `getDreamImage`/`deleteDreamImage` + the `isDreamImagePath` guard (the `08` §13.2 `isMediaPath` mirror).
  Pricing: `IMAGE_PRICING` + a flat-image branch in `costOf` (zero-token image events cost the per-image price,
  not $0). Code-reviewer **ship** (privacy boundary verified structurally airtight — **OpenAI only ever sees
  the Claude-distilled prompt, never the narrative or a name**; metering correct on the refused-vs-billed-vs-
  pre-gen split; a failed regenerate keeps the prior image; the path-guard confines I/O; applied the nit —
  dropped two unused pricing exports per §12). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **266
  core + 328 desktop + 8 relay** unit (+18 core: full distill→render→encrypt→stamp→meter round-trip, the
  name/private-never-reaches-distillation security units, REFUSED-not-metered, billed-error-metered,
  regenerate non-destructive + shareableWith carried, the path guard, the pure prompt builder, `buildDepictionNote`
  - `ageFromBirthday`, the flat-cost pricing; +2 desktop fake-image-client). Built in the
    **`feat/dream-images-slice-2`** worktree off `main`. **Lesson: a two-provider privacy boundary is enforced
    by making OpenAI's ONLY input the Claude-distilled output — never the raw narrative/depiction — and by
    assembling the depiction in ONE name-free/private-free function (`buildDepictionNote`), so the name-exclusion
    is structural, not a filter that can be bypassed.** **NEXT: slice 3 — the IPC seam (`dreams:generateImage`/
    `:getImage`/`:deleteImage`) + settings (consent toggle, admin OpenAI key control + model select, default
    style) + the `dreams.generateImage` capability + the `image` host part in `createCoreBridge`.**
- 2026-06-12 — Build (**Dream-images slice 1 — the People-profile amendment**;
  [13-dream-images](docs/specs/13-dream-images.md) §4.6/§13.1, [04-people-roles](docs/specs/04-people-roles.md)
  §4.1). The first slice of the approved spec 13 (AI dream-image generation), but **independently valuable and
  imageless** — new descriptive `Person` fields used as coaching context **app-wide**. **Asked first** (the one
  open §11.3 build-time confirmation): `gender` = **Female / Male / Non-binary / Prefer not to say + free-text
  "Other…"** (user confirmed the spec proposal). **Schema:** additive-optional fields on
  `PersonSchema`/`PersonInputSchema` — SHAREABLE (`gender`, `appearanceDescription`, `ethnicity`, `occupation`,
  `interests[]`, `location`, `goals`, `communicationStyle`, `values[]`, `languages[]`,
  `importantDates[{label,date}]`) + PRIVATE (`healthNotes`, `faith`); **no `schemaVersion` bump, no migration**
  (the `email`/`phone` precedent); **`birthday` reused** for age, not duplicated. Threaded through
  `upsertPerson` (conditional spreads — a cleared field drops, doesn't linger). **Context:** two new pure
  helpers `shareableProfileLines`/`privateProfileLines` in `buildContext.ts` — the shareable set feeds the
  person's **own AND related/linked** people's context (the `publicNotes` "may feed others' AI" bucket), the
  private set feeds **only** the person's own block (the `privateNotes` boundary). `buildContext` (related
  loop) + `buildLinkedPeopleContext` both surface only the shareable set. **Renderer:** `PersonEditor` gained
  a Profile-tab **birthday** input (previously unreachable in the UI — the depiction's age source) and a new
  **About** tab — a shared group (gender = preset Select + free-text "Other…" reveal; `ChipEditor` for
  interests/values/languages; a label+date `importantDates` row editor) and a Private group (health/faith,
  marked "never shared with anyone else's AI, never sent to an image provider"). Code-reviewer verdict **ship**
  (privacy boundary verified airtight on every path — health/faith reach only the person's own block, never a
  related/linked person; applied the one nit: a clear-on-edit drop test). Gate green: typecheck (node +
  web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **248 core + 326 desktop** unit (+5 core: shareable/private context split,
  linked-person private exclusion, descriptive round-trip, clean-absence, clear-on-edit; +2 RTL: About save +
  gender-Other reveal), **E2E** (+1 encrypted About round-trip; the 390px sweep now walks the About tab incl.
  the densest important-dates row). Visual QA at desktop + 390px (the important-dates row stays single-line
  inline at desktop via a small flex CSS module, wraps cleanly at phone width; the Private card reads as
  intentional). Built in the **`feat/dream-images-slice-1`** worktree off `main`. **Lesson: a date-row whose
  fields flex-grow will push a trailing remove button to wrap below even at desktop — pin the label to
  `flex:1 1 0; min-width:0` and the date/remove to `flex:0 0 auto` so the row stays inline wide and wraps only
  when it must.** **NEXT: slice 2 — the image core backend** (`ImageClient` host interface + OpenAI impl +
  offline fake; `buildDepictionNote`/`buildImagePromptInput` name-free; `dreamImageService`; the `dream.image`
  flat + `dream.imagePrompt` token usage types).
- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Dreams amendment — link "people present" to the People graph**, finishing the §13.2
  deferral; [12-dreams](docs/specs/12-dreams.md) §3.1/§4.2/§5.1/§8.4 + §13 item 6). A dream's "people
  present" can now be **linked to a real household person** so the AI dream analysis draws on that person's
  **shareable** context. **Asked first (3 forks, all confirmed):** which people are selectable = **all
  household people** (the dreamer excluded); how much linked-person context feeds = the **full shareable
  set** (display name + relationship type + relationship/public notes + shareable insight facts); picker UX
  = **hybrid pick-or-type**. **Core:** new **`buildLinkedPeopleContext`** (`@selfos/core/people`, a sibling
  of `buildContext`) — the shareable-only context block for a set of linked `personId`s, **never** their
  private notes/non-shareable facts (the §8.4 boundary — byte-identical to `summarizeForContext`'s
  `shareable || shareableWith.includes(viewer)` rule), holding **even for a linked non-relation** (public
  notes are the "may feed others' AI" bucket — they feed; private data never does). `buildDreamPrompt` now
  takes the `Dream` and appends this for the dream's linked people, foregrounded as "People from your life
  who appeared in this dream." `DreamPersonRef` already carried `personId` (**no schema change, no
  migration**). **Renderer:** a new **`DreamPeopleEditor`** (link a household person from a dropdown —
  already-linked + the dreamer filtered out — or type a free name; linked chips carry a link icon + accent
  "linked" badge) replaces the free-text-only people `ChipEditor` in `DreamComposer` (now stores
  `DreamPersonRef[]`, loads the household via `peopleStore`, excludes the active dreamer; re-exported
  `DreamPersonRef` through `channels`). **Patterns follow-on:** people-frequency now resolves linked figures
  to real people (`personId` carried through `tallyPeople`). Code-reviewer **ship** (no blockers/should-fix;
  privacy boundary verified airtight on every path incl. non-relations + tampered ids; applied the one UX
  nit — a free name that duplicates an already-linked person's display name is rejected). Gate green:
  typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **239 core + 315 desktop + 8 relay** unit (+4
  `buildLinkedPeopleContext`, +1 prompt-private-never-leaks core; +6 `DreamPeopleEditor` RTL, +1 composer
  linked-payload RTL), **37 E2E** (+1: link a household person → save → reopen → the `personId` resolves
  back to the household name, both chip styles, 390px no-overflow). **Visual QA** at desktop + 390px (linked
  vs free chips read as distinct + intentional; the picker self-hides when no one's left to link). Built in
  the isolated **`feat/dreams-people-link`** worktree off `main`. **Lesson: any household person is
  linkable, but the shareable-vs-private boundary still holds without a relationship — `publicNotes` +
  `shareable`/`shareableWith` facts feed, private data never does; the relationship graph only _labels_ the
  link.** **NEXT (the other half of this work): the deferred AI dream-image-generation companion spec
  (§11.2) — spec-first.**
- 2026-06-11 — Build + decision (Questionnaires **close-out — QR cut, recipient image-gating fixed, editable
  delivery templates**, [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §3.2/§4.5/§6/§13.2). **User
  decision: QR delivery removed from the spec entirely** (decision #17 + §3.2) — copy/mailto/SMS/native-share
  cover delivery; QR would need a local QR encoder to keep the link off a third-party service. **Bug fix:**
  the `questionnaires:getImage` IPC was gated by `questionnaires.create` only, so an in-app recipient
  (`answer`, not `create` — only reachable via a custom role, since default Member has both) saw **null** for
  author images in the Inbox. Now a non-`create` person may read an image **only if it's referenced by a
  questionnaire sent to THEM** (the bridge scans the active person's recipient assignments) — so the Inbox
  shows author images without letting an answerer enumerate the household's media (the bridge is the trust
  boundary, not the renderer). **Built `questionnaires.defaultMessages`** (the deferred "editable in Settings"
  piece): a vault-scoped setting in the Questionnaires section holding `{ emailSubject, emailBody, smsBody }`
  with **`{sender}`/`{link}` placeholders** + a custom control (`RelayMessagesControl`, three fields + reset);
  the external send panel sources its email/SMS defaults from it (PIN appended/omitted by the per-send
  toggle) and stays tweakable per send (the panel + control fall back to `DEFAULT_RELAY_MESSAGES` when the
  vault value is unseeded). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **238 core + 317 desktop
  unit, 45 E2E** (+9: relayMessages builders, the control RTL incl. edit-persists + reset, and a bridge
  recipient-reads-only-their-own-assigned-image test); web-preview visual QA of the templates control at
  desktop + 390px (no console errors). Synced `08` §3.2/§13.2 + changelog. **Lesson: a media-read IPC shared
  by an author (`create`) and a recipient (`answer`) must SCOPE the recipient's reads to media referenced by
  THEIR assignments — a blanket loosen-to-`answer` would let any answerer read by path; the recipient-scoping
  pattern (already used across §13.5) is the trust boundary.** **The Questionnaires feature (spec 08) is now
  fully built with no deferred image/delivery items; only the user's real Cloudflare deploy + the iOS
  worker-bundle wiring + two product/policy calls (explicit-tier App Store stance §11.2, starter-taxonomy
  wording §11.8) remain.**

- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **§13.2 image follow-ups — orphan GC + purge-on-delete**,
  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §3.9/§13.2). Closes the two deferred question-image
  cleanups. Core **`imageGc.garbageCollectImages`** (`@selfos/core/questionnaires`) reaps every stored
  image (`questionnaires/media/<id>.enc`) referenced by **no live definition AND no send snapshot**; run
  after **`purgeQuestionnaire`/`deleteSend`** (purge-on-delete) and, in the bridge `questionnairesSave`
  handler, after an edit that **drops** an image (the draft-remove orphan the §13.2 builder leaves behind —
  "remove" only clears the draft). **Key correctness rule (the whole reason GC scans snapshots, not just
  defs):** an image removed from a definition may **still be frozen in an already-sent snapshot** the
  recipient/Results need — so it's kept until that send is also deleted. Dependency-light (inlines the def
  scan; no `questionnaireService` import) to avoid an import cycle. Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib),
  lint, format, **238 core + 309 desktop unit** (+5: core `imageGc` orphan/keep/snapshot-keeps-it/shared-image
  - a bridge edit-removes-image-reaps test), affected E2E (image round-trip + the re-ask→delete→purge flow)
    re-run green. Synced `08` §3.9/§13.2. **Lesson: GC over a SHARED store decoupled from one entity's lifecycle
    must scan EVERY referrer (here both live defs and frozen send snapshots) — reaping by the live def alone
    would delete an image a sent snapshot still needs.** **The only remaining image follow-up is `getImage`
    recipient/Inbox gating (currently `create`-only); the Questionnaires feature is otherwise fully built.**
- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **slice §13.6 — the external Cloudflare relay; the Questionnaires
  feature is now FULLY BUILT** except the deferred §13.2 image follow-ups + the AI image-gen companion spec;
  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §3.2/§3.4/§3.5/§3.8/§3.9/§4.1/§4.5/§5.1/§5.2/§5.4/§6/
  §8.3/§8.6/§11/§13.6). **The whole relay on ONE branch** (the user chose this over sub-slicing — the pieces
  are coupled). All decisions **asked first** (2 rounds, all recommendations confirmed): fake Worker/Cloudflare
  now (`SELFOS_FAKE_RELAY`) + user deploys/verifies later (blind-written like the iOS bits); **image ZK
  included**; spec **§11 retention/domain/crisis defaults confirmed**; relay page mirrors the SelfOS look,
  English v1. **Extraction:** the shared answering renderer → a new **`@selfos/answering`** package
  (`QuestionnaireForm` + `QuestionImage` + `CrisisFooter`, self-contained — plain elements + design-token CSS,
  no app design-system) so Electron + the relay page render ONE implementation (in-app callers pass the
  Sessions `CrisisFooter` so behaviour is byte-identical; the suite is the proof). **Relay crypto
  (`@selfos/core/relay`):** per-send **ECDH P-256** (responses sealed to the public key in the browser, opened
  with the private key wrapped under the master key), a symmetric **content key** in the URL **fragment**
  sealing questions + images (never seen by the server), a 6-digit **PIN**, and the pure **mailbox ops** the
  Worker calls — all through ONE shared PIN gate (5 attempts → 15-min lockout). **`relayService`** mints
  `Assignment.relay` at send (re-encrypting question images into the snapshot), drains + decrypts + purges,
  revokes. **`apps/relay` Worker** — a zero-knowledge mailbox + a branded WCAG responsive **static answering
  page** (bundles `@selfos/answering` + `@selfos/core/relay` → one `dist/worker.js` the app uploads; strict CSP;
  ≤256 KB single submissions; serves the derived disclosure + static crisis resources + the privacy notice +
  the trust line; drain/revoke authed by `drainSecret`). **Host:** `cloudflareDeployer` (provision KV + deploy/
  update/teardown via the Cloudflare REST API) + `relayHttpClient` + `relayConfig` (`config/relay.enc` —
  endpoint + drainSecret + **encrypted CF token**, host-side only, **never crossing IPC**); deployer + transport
  are interfaces with fakes. **Renderer:** the admin-only **Settings → Relay** panel (with the "Admin only"
  marker — also fixed the `custom`-control `SettingField` to render that badge), the external send + delivery
  (link + PIN, Copy / mailto / SMS / native share, PIN-included default + sensitive opt-out), the drain flow,
  and external delivery + revoke in Results. **Sensitive gates on the relay page** (18+ ack / DOB+consent →
  `ConsentReceipt`) + **revoke-on-deletion** (§3.9). Code-reviewer **fix-first**: **a blocker** — the PIN
  rate-limit had guarded only `unlock`, leaving `respond`/`withdraw` as **unthrottled brute-force oracles**;
  now all three share one `pinGate` so a wrong PIN on ANY endpoint counts toward the lockout (+ a cross-endpoint
  test); should-fixes applied (the IPC contract carries `privacy`; drain skips already-drained sends). Gate
  green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **234 core + 308 desktop + 8 relay unit, 45 E2E**. Live
  web-preview visual QA (admin Relay connect → connected; external send → delivery; desktop + 390px; no console
  errors). Synced `08`/`00`/`03`. **Lesson: a rate-limit that lives on ONE endpoint is no rate-limit — every
  endpoint that checks the same secret (PIN) must share one gate that increments on each failure, or an
  unthrottled sibling endpoint (`respond`/`withdraw`) becomes a brute-force oracle for it.** **Deploy-time
  verification (the real Cloudflare provision/deploy + shipping `worker.js` into the iOS bundle) is the only
  remaining user-driven step.**

- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **slice §13.5d — COMPATIBILITY mode; §13.5 COMPLETE — the
  Questionnaires feature is fully built** except the deferred §13.6 relay; [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md)
  §3.6/§3.9/§4.1/§4.3/§4.4/§4.5/§6/§8.4/§13.5d). **The whole compatibility feature on ONE branch, merged
  once** (its pieces are tightly coupled — authoring → AI variants → dual-send → alignment — so shipping them
  separately would leave dead controls, §12). All product/UX decisions were **pre-made** (no re-asking).
  **Capability:** `questionnaires.readRaw` registered as an **`EXPLICIT_GRANT_ONLY`** capability — ships OFF
  even for the Owner (`roleAllows` special-cases it BEFORE the Owner's full-access bypass; the Roles matrix
  leaves the Owner column toggleable for exactly these). **Authoring:** a builder compatibility toggle +
  visibility picker (`sharedReport`/`eachSeesOwn`/`senderSeesAll`; the last selectable only with `readRaw`) +
  per-question `canonicalId` stamping. **Variants + dual-send:** core **`generateVariant`** (AI personalizes
  each answerer's variant — same answer type + `canonicalId`; target **shareable-facts-only** context, the
  §13.3 boundary) + **`createCompatibilitySend`** (two paired **Private** assignments sharing an additive
  **`Assignment.compatibilityGroupId`**, each freezing its own variant snapshot); blocked when AI is off.
  **Alignment:** **`alignmentService`** (both submitted → align by `canonicalId` → an **`AlignmentReport`** at
  `questionnaires/compat/<groupId>/report.enc` + a draft Insight, subject = sender, `approved:false`,
  deduped by `provenance.compatibilityGroupId`; budget-gated `questionnaire.analyze`); the sender's
  **`CompatibilityResults`** view + the answerer's **joint report on their answered Inbox item** (per
  visibility; `eachSeesOwn` also shows their own answers). **Break-glass + audit:** **`auditService`**
  (encrypted cross-device `config/raw-access-audit.enc`); IPC **`assignments:revealRaw`** (permits ONLY the
  super-admin (any send) **or** a `senderSeesAll` sender holding `readRaw`; **writes the audit entry BEFORE
  returning answers**) + **`audit:list`** (super-admin only) + a super-admin **`/audit`** viewer surface.
  **Honest disclosure:** **`disclosure.ts`** (`compatibilityDisclosure` per visibility, shared by send panel
  - Inbox) + the **`questionnaires.discloseAdminAccess`** admin-only setting (a new `adminOnly`
    `SettingDefinition` flag — filtered + marked "Admin only"; default OFF). Deletion tears down the compat
    report + group Insight. Code-reviewer **ship** (no blockers; applied the should-fixes: collapsed a double
    snapshot-decrypt in `revealRaw`, added the readRaw-sender-vs-non-`senderSeesAll`-group denial test, guarded
    a sender from being their own recipient; the reveal/`readRaw`/audit boundaries verified airtight). Gate
    green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **213 core + 294 desktop unit, 44 E2E**. Live
    web-preview visual QA (compat authoring toggle + visibility picker [`senderSeesAll` gated "needs
    permission"] + derived disclosure + the admin-only setting with the "Admin only" marker; desktop + 390px;
    no console errors). Synced `08` + `capabilities`. **Lesson: an `EXPLICIT_GRANT_ONLY` capability must be
    special-cased in `roleAllows` BEFORE the Owner full-access bypass (else the Owner auto-grants the very thing
    meant to ship off), and a break-glass reveal must WRITE THE AUDIT ENTRY BEFORE returning the answers so a
    mid-reveal crash still leaves the trail.** **NEXT (the only remaining questionnaire work): §13.6 — the
    external Cloudflare relay.**
- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **slice §13.5c — per-question trends + deletion/purge**,
  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §3.7/§3.9/§4.2/§6/§8.4/§13.5; design-system
  [01](docs/specs/01-design-system.md) §5.3/§5.6). **Scope decision (asked, twice):** the user chose "all
  three together" (trends + compatibility + deletion) **and** all 3 compatibility visibility modes (which
  pulls in the deferred break-glass `readRaw` + audit). After building the tractable two-thirds I **flagged
  the true size honestly + asked again** — the user chose to **ship trends + deletion now as §13.5c** and do
  **compatibility as a focused §13.5d**. **Privacy call (asked, with a clear warning):** trends **include
  Private sends' numeric values** — which contradicts the "they won't see your raw responses" promise; the
  user chose to **reconcile by updating the Private disclosure** (send panel + Inbox now say numeric ratings
  may appear in the sender's trends), so the app stays honest to recipients (§3.2). **Trends:** core
  **`buildQuestionTrends`** (rating-over-time across re-asks; rating/slider + matrix/allocation per
  row/bucket; one series per recipient; ≥2 points) + the **`assignments:trends`** IPC (sender-scoped, gated
  `viewResults`; numbers only, never prose); `QuestionTrend`/`TrendSeries`/`TrendPoint` view types; a
  **token-driven, theme-aware `LineChart`** primitive (+ `--color-chart-1..4` tokens) in `/gallery`; a Trends
  section in Results. **Deletion/purge (§3.9):** core **`purgeQuestionnaire`** (def + all sends + responses +
  derived Insights) + `deleteSend` + `hasSends`; a **main-stamped `Questionnaire.creatorPersonId`**
  (additive-optional, create-only, **never back-filled** onto a legacy def); **role-aware
  `questionnaires:delete`** (Owner/super-admin purge any stage; a non-owner creator deletes their own **only
  while unsent**) + a per-send **`assignments:delete`** (sender/admin-only); inline "Are you sure?" confirms
  in the builder + each Results send card. Live web-preview QA: the trend chart renders cleanly (2→4 line +
  legend), the delete confirms work, no console errors, no 390px overflow. Code-reviewer **ship** (2
  should-fixes applied: a forbidden delete surfaces a **calm inline error** instead of an unhandled throw;
  editing a legacy creator-less def **no longer transfers authorship** to the editor — which would have let a
  Member delete an Owner's def). Gate green: typecheck/lint/format, **243 desktop + 159 core unit, 38 E2E**
  (a coreBridge test proving Private numbers reach trends + per-send delete is sender/admin-only, deletion +
  trends core tests, a `LineChart` RTL test, and an E2E re-ask→chart→delete-send→purge with a 390px guard).
  Synced `08` + `01`. **Lesson: turning a silent no-op (the old `questionnaires:delete`) into a throw means
  every caller must handle the rejection — `void onRemove()` in the renderer would otherwise swallow it into
  an unhandled rejection with no user feedback. When a gate newly throws, audit its callers.** **Next:
  §13.5d** (compatibility: AI variants + dual-send + alignment report + Insight + the 3 visibility modes +
  the `readRaw` capability + audit), then **§13.6** (the external relay).

  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §3.7/§4.5/§6/§13.5). **This lights up the analysis loop**
  the §13.4 Memory surface was waiting on — a sender can now see a send's outcome and turn a response into a
  draft Insight. **Decisions (asked, all 4):** Results lives as an **Edit ⇄ Preview ⇄ Results** toggle in the
  questionnaire detail (only on a saved questionnaire + `questionnaires.viewResults`); **Standard = raw Q&A
  shown, Private = Analyze-only** (raw hidden; break-glass `readRaw` stays deferred); after Analyze, an inline
  **"Insight drafted — review it in Memory →"** confirmation (the Memory approve-step stays the one review
  place); **`autoAnalyze` default OFF**, and when ON it **auto-runs on opening Results** for new responses
  (spends the sender's AI allowance). Core **`formatAnswerForDisplay`** (read-only display per answer type incl.
  ranking/matrix/allocation) + derived **`SendResult`/`SendAnswer`** view types. IPC
  **`assignments:results(questionnaireId)`** — **sender-scoped + gated by `questionnaires.viewResults`**, with
  the **privacy boundary enforced in the bridge** (raw `answers` only for a Standard + submitted send; a Private
  send carries none — the reviewer verified airtight). Live **Analyze** reuses `insights:analyze` (the sender
  pays + reviews in Memory). New **`questionnaires.autoAnalyze`** setting (boolean, default OFF, `visibleWhen`
  AI on) + a **Questionnaires** settings section; the Results view auto-runs analysis one-at-a-time via a
  `useRef` guard that never retries a failed/over-budget attempt. Calm "Turn on AI in Settings" state when AI
  is off (no dead Analyze button). Code-reviewer verdict **ship** (nits applied: a Standard-but-unreadable
  response no longer mislabels as private; a store `loaded` flag removes a one-frame empty-state flash).
  Live web-preview visual QA of all three send states (Standard raw, Private locked, Sent waiting) + the calm
  Analyze degradation + the settings toggle, desktop + 390px, no console errors. Gate green:

  RTL for the Results states + the builder Results tab, an E2E send→answer→submit→Results raw round-trip with a
  390px guard). Synced `08` §3/§4.5/§6/§13.5. **Lesson: a derived "view" type at the IPC seam is how you keep a
  privacy promise — `SendResult` carries answers only for Standard sends, so a Private send's raw answers
  physically cannot reach the sender's renderer (the boundary is the bridge, not the UI).** **Next: §13.5c**

  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §3.2/§3.3/§6/§13.5). **This finally lights up the loop:**
  a sender can send a questionnaire in-app and a recipient can answer it. **Decisions (asked):** scope =
  **the core loop** (send + Inbox + answer; Results/Analyze deferred to §13.5b, trends/compat/deletion to
  §13.5c); Inbox = a **separate `/inbox` nav** gated by **`questionnaires.answer`** (unanswered badge);
  Send = **from the builder** (a "Send" button beside Save → validate + save first, then a recipient +
  privacy panel that freezes the immutable snapshot); privacy default = **Private (break-glass)** — the
  recipient is told their answers personalize the sender's coaching and the raw responses stay hidden.
  Core **`@selfos/core/questionnaires/answerService`** (`openAssignment`/`saveProgress`/`submitResponse`/
  `declineAssignment` + an `isAnswerable` guard — locked after submit); `listAssignments` gains a
  **`recipientPersonId`** filter (the Inbox side); **`ResponseSet.submittedAt` → optional** (a saved-but-
  unsubmitted draft persists; status is the lifecycle marker) and **`Answer.value` widened to
  `Record<string,number>`** (matrix/allocation answers now persist) — both additive, **no migration**.
  New **derived** `InboxItem`/`InboxAssignmentDetail` view types — the **raw answers never cross IPC to the
  sender** (privacy honesty). IPC `assignments:inbox/get/open/saveProgress/submit/decline` gated by
  `questionnaires.answer` **AND recipient-scoped in the bridge** (the trust boundary — a non-recipient can't
  read or mutate another person's send; super-admin inspect still can't answer-as-someone-else because it
  doesn't change `activePersonId`). Renderer: a builder **Send panel** + a separate **Inbox** master-detail
  reusing `QuestionnaireForm` (save/resume, decline silent/with-note, submit; crisis footer on every state);
  per-person **`inboxStore`** resets on `activePerson.id` change (the per-person-state rule); the nav badge
  carries `flex: none` (the Switch-shrink rule — the reviewer's preview caught it compressed). Code-reviewed
  **fix-first** (should-fix: **`analyzeAssignment` now guards on `submittedAt`** so a draft can't be analyzed
  or burn budget — drafts are newly reachable as `ResponseSet`s; + crisis footer on locked/declining/missing).
  Gate green (typecheck/lint/format, **227 desktop + 147 core unit, 36 E2E** — incl. a coreBridge inbox-flow/
  recipient-gating test, RTL Inbox + builder-send tests, and an E2E send→answer→submit encrypted round-trip;
  the 390px sweep now walks the Inbox). Synced `08` §3/§4.3/§6/§13.5. **Lesson: relaxing a "required" schema
  field (`submittedAt`) makes a previously-unreachable state (a draft `ResponseSet`) reachable — re-check
  every consumer that assumed the old invariant (here, `analyzeAssignment`).** **Next: §13.5b** (Results +
  the live Analyze trigger + `autoAnalyze` — lights up Memory), then §13.5c, then §13.6 relay.
- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **slice 4 — analyze → Insights → Memory** [§13.4 engine + surface],
  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §3.7/§4.4/§6/§8.2/§13.4). **Surfaced a real
  dependency + asked:** §13.4 analyzes a recipient's submitted answers, but the Inbox that collects them is
  §13.5 — so there's no live response source yet. Decisions: **build §13.4 now** (engine + surface,
  seeded-tested, live trigger with §13.5); a **top-level "Memory" nav**; an **inline review panel** for the
  approve-step; crisis flags **lead with concern + resources**. Built: core **`analysisService`**
  (`analyzeAssignment` → an Insight saved **`approved:false`**, `subjectPersonId` = the **sender**;
  budget-gated + metered `questionnaire.analyze`; model **crisisFlag**; **idempotent** — dedup by
  `provenance.assignmentId`); `insightStore` **`listAllInsights`** (+ `updateInsight` for approve);
  IPC `insights:list/analyze/approve/update/delete` gated by **`questionnaires.viewResults`** (analyze via
  a capability-parametrized `aiDeps`). The **Memory** surface lists every Insight, drafts open in an inline
  review (edit summary, choose **shareable** facts, Approve/Discard), crisis-flagged lead with 988 +
  resources + the crisis footer. **Privacy (reviewer-verified airtight):** the surface/IPC only carry the
  **derived Insight**, never the raw answers; unapproved Insights don't feed `buildContext`. Code-reviewer
  **fix-first** (3 applied): the Approve card now **collapses** to the read view (a `useEffect` syncs
  `editing` to `approved` — `useState` doesn't re-run on `key` reuse); approve/update/remove failures
  surface a **calm inline error** (no swallow); analysis **dedups**. Gate green: typecheck/lint/format,
  **219 desktop** + **140 core** unit, **35 E2E** (Memory empty-state + the 390px sweep now walks Memory).
  Visual QA of the empty Memory surface (the insight-card/approve form is RTL-covered — no live insight in
  the preview, since none exist until §13.5). **DELIBERATELY DEFERRED (no dead code, §12):** the
  **`autoAnalyze`** setting + the live `Analyze` trigger → **§13.5** (where responses arrive), and
  **`queryMetrics`** → **§11** (its consumer) — flagged rather than ship a dead toggle. **NEXT: §13.5
  send/collect + Inbox** (reuses `QuestionnaireForm`; produces the responses that finally light up
  Analyze/Memory), then **§13.6 relay.** Synced `08` §6/§13.4 + changelog.
- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **slice 3 — AI generate + gap-finder** [the FULL §13.3],
  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §3.1/§3.7/§5.1/§6/§8.1/§13.3). Asked first (4 Qs):
  scope = **everything** (registry + generate + per-question assists + the gap-finder surface); generate
  context = **configurable sources** (the user's words — pick one or more of **own data / a target person /
  the relationship between them**); generated questions = **append as editable** (AI-marked); safety =
  **prompt-embedded + schema-validate** (no separate judge). Built: the **context-provider registry**
  (`registerContextProvider` + built-in profiles/relationships/insights — the extensibility backbone `09`
  will extend) + `gatherGenerationContext`; **generationService** (`generateQuestions` brief+context → JSON
  → Zod-validate → mint ids → de-dup; `improveQuestion`) + **gapFinderService** (`suggestQuestionnaires`,
  structured context only — **never raw transcripts**), each mirroring `chatService`'s **budget→call→record**
  (gated by `questionnaires.create`, metered `questionnaire.generate`/`.suggest`; refusals degrade to a calm
  `REFUSED`, still charged). **Privacy boundary (airtight, reviewer-verified):** a **target person's data is
  shareable-facts-only** — their private notes never reach Claude (the §04/§8.4 split, like `buildContext`);
  the author's own private data does feed. The API key stays in main. IPC `questionnaires:generate`/
  `:improveQuestion`/`gapfinder:suggest`. Renderer: a builder **"Draft with AI"** panel (brief + target
  picker + context toggles), per-question **reword** assists, the **"Suggested"** surface; AI-off /
  over-budget show calm states. Code-reviewer **fix-first** (all 4 should-fixes applied): a denial now
  returns a distinct **`DENIED`** (not `NO_KEY`); the per-question reword is **gated on AI-ready + debounced**
  (no double-charge); a test asserts **usage is recorded even on REFUSED**; a **390px guard** exercises the
  AI panel + Suggested. Gate green: typecheck/lint/format, **215 desktop** + **133 core** unit, **34 E2E**.
  Visual QA of the calm states (the AI-ready UI is RTL-covered — the web preview couldn't reach `aiReady`
  without a real key). **Lesson: at 390px the nav is a hidden drawer — E2E that navigates must do so at
  desktop width (or open the hamburger first), then resize only to measure layout.** **Deferred:** the
  analyze→Insight pipeline + `autoAnalyze` (§13.4). **NEXT: §13.4 analyze→Insights/metrics, then §13.5
  send/Inbox, §13.6 relay.** Synced `08` §3.1/§5.1/§6/§13.3 + changelog.
- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Dreams slice 5b — the sharing UI; §13.5 COMPLETE — the Dreams feature is fully
  built**; [12-dreams](docs/specs/12-dreams.md) §3.4/§8.3/§13.5). A **`DreamShareControls`** section on the
  approved analysis card: a **related-person picker** + a `Switch` **per insight fact** (on = shared with
  the selected person) + a **"Shared with X" line** per fact. It renders only when `analysis.insightId &&
can('dreams.shareContext') && sensitivity === 'standard'` and the dreamer has related people — but the
  **bridge re-enforces the capability + sensitivity + target-is-related + fact-exists server-side, so the
  UI gate is convenience, not the trust boundary**. A **sensitive-tier dream shows a one-line "kept out of
  shared context" note** instead. `dreamAnalysisStore` gained `insight`/`shareTargets` +
  `loadSharing`/`setFactShare` (loaded after approve / re-approve-on-edit / open-when-approved; cleared on
  remove + reset). **Fixed a real footgun the reviewer caught (should-fix → applied):** editing an approved
  analysis used to **silently wipe all per-person sharing** (`approveAnalysis` rebuilt facts with fresh
  `uuid()`s) — facts now use a **stable per-field id** (`<insightId>:waking`/`:emotional`) and **carry
  `shareableWith` forward** on re-approval, so re-wording a section **keeps** its shares with the updated
  text (re-_synthesizing_ a wholly new analysis still resets sharing, correctly). Applied the two nits
  (surface an `error` if a share toggle is refused; reconcile a stale selected person so the controls never
  point at a removed relation). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **164 core + 249
  desktop** unit (+1 core carry-forward, +6 RTL: component toggles/already-shared/empty + pane integration /
  sensitive note / capability-hide), **36 E2E** (+1 full capture→analyze→approve→**share** flow that
  decrypts the vault to assert the shared fact reaches the related person's `summarizeForContext` grounding
  - a 390px guard). **Visual QA** at desktop (the share section — picker + per-fact toggles + the "Shared
    with Partner" chip — renders cleanly, no overflow). On `feat/dreams-slice-5b` (in the Dreams worktree).
    **Lesson: any derived record (a distilled Insight's facts) that the user can attach state to (sharing
    toggles) must carry that state across regeneration via STABLE ids — rebuilding with fresh uuids silently
    drops the user's choices.** **The Dreams feature (spec 12, §13.1–§13.5) is now FULLY BUILT** — capture →
    guided analysis → patterns → per-dream sharing. Only the deferred AI dream-image-generation companion
    spec remains. (Concurrent questionnaire session's main-tree work untouched.)
- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Dreams slice 5a — per-dream sharing backend + IPC seam**;
  [12-dreams](docs/specs/12-dreams.md) §3.4/§8.3/§8.4/§6/§13.5). The **per-person** dream-insight sharing
  mechanism. **Asked first (2 forks, both confirmed):** the shareable unit = the **distilled insight facts**
  (the emotional-landscape + waking-life-connection facts approval produces); the control = **pick a related
  person, tick which facts**. Added an **additive-optional `InsightFact.shareableWith: string[]`** (the
  person ids a fact is targeted at, alongside the broadcast `shareable` boolean — **no migration**, existing
  questionnaire/session facts unaffected); **`summarizeForContext`** now surfaces a related person's fact
  when `shareable` **OR** `shareableWith.includes(thatPerson)` (the boolean broadcast path unchanged). New
  **`dreamInsightService`** (`@selfos/core/dreams`): `listDreamShareTargets` (the dreamer's relationship-
  graph relations — via a new exported **`listRelatedPeople`**), `getDreamInsight` (the dream's approved
  Insight + its facts/sharing), **`setDreamFactShare`** (toggles a person in a fact's `shareableWith`;
  **refuses sensitive-tier dreams** [`SENSITIVE`] + a **non-related/unknown target** [`NOT_FOUND`]; drops the
  prop when empty). IPC seam: `dreams:shareTargets` + `:getInsight` gated by **`dreams.own`**;
  `dreams:setFactShare` gated by the privileged **`dreams.shareContext`** (a Member has both by default; a
  Guest neither). New crypto-free view types `DreamShareTarget`/`DreamShareResult`. Code-reviewer verdict
  **ship** — the **privacy boundary verified airtight on every path** (a targeted fact reaches ONLY its
  target, never other related or unrelated people; the **relationship graph re-gates at read time** so
  deleting a relationship drops the share — no stale `shareableWith` leak; sensitive tiers excluded;
  others'-private + the boolean paths unchanged). Applied the two nits (a dedup-divergence doc note on
  `listRelatedPeople` vs `buildContext`'s inline traversal; a broadcast-path regression test). Gate green:
  typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **162 core + 243 desktop** unit (+7 core sharing/targeting,
  +1 bridge round-trip/gating). On `feat/dreams-slice-5a` (in the Dreams worktree). **Lesson: per-person
  sharing rides on an additive `InsightFact.shareableWith` checked in `summarizeForContext` (`shareable ||
shareableWith.includes(reader)`) — and the relationship graph re-gates at READ time, so a shared fact
  auto-revokes when the relationship is removed; no separate revocation needed.** **No user-facing surface,
  so no E2E/visual-QA** — the share UI on the approved, non-sensitive analysis card (a related-person picker
  - per-fact ticks + "shared with X" chips) lands in **5b**. (Concurrent questionnaire session's main-tree
    work untouched.)
- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Dreams slice 4b — the Patterns UI; §13.4 COMPLETE**;
  [12-dreams](docs/specs/12-dreams.md) §3.5/§5.3/§8.2/§9/§13.4). The **`/dreams/patterns`** screen + three
  **new `/gallery` chart primitives**. Built bespoke SVG/bars on tokens (**no chart library** — matching
  the hand-rolled usage ring) with the **count/figure always rendered as text** (not colour-only, §9):
  **`FrequencyBars`** (recurring symbols/themes/people/emotions), **`ProportionBar`** (lucid/nightmare
  rates), **`TrendLine`** (mood/vividness over time, a direction-aware `role="img"` label) — all exported
  from the design-system + **showcased in `/gallery`** (DoD). **`DreamPatterns`** composes the four §3.5
  visualizations into cards + a **30d / 90d / All-time** `SegmentedControl` + the **gentle recurring-
  nightmare nudge** Banner (when `nightmareNudge`) + the **on-demand** AI narrative card (Generate →
  Approve/Remove + the "in your coaching context" badge; disabled+hinted when `dreams.memoryEnabled` is off;
  a calm connect-Claude state when AI is off — **the deterministic charts still render offline**) + the
  not-medical line + the reused `CrisisFooter`. Reached via a **"Patterns" button in the Dreams header**.
  A per-person **`dreamPatternStore`** (reset wired into AppShell's active-person effect). The §8.2 nudge
  **also surfaces in the dream detail** — a gentle `distressSignal` banner on the synthesis card. All four
  product/UX forks were **asked + user-confirmed** (nudge = 3-in-14-days; the window toggle; on-demand
  generation; the header-button entry). Code-reviewer **fix-first** (should-fix: a `load()` late-resolve
  **window guard** so a fast toggle can't show stale stats; nits: the `!`→guarded-access §4 fix, a
  direction-aware TrendLine label, `title` on truncated bars). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib),
  lint, format, **156 core + 242 desktop** unit (+4 chart RTL, +7 Patterns RTL), **35 E2E** (+1: seeds 3
  nightmares + an analyzed dream → the charts render, the nudge fires, generate+approve the narrative, a
  390px overflow guard). **Visual QA** at desktop + 390px via real Electron screenshots (charts legible,
  the grid stacks). On `feat/dreams-slice-4b` (in the Dreams worktree). **Lesson: build in-app charts as
  bespoke token-driven SVG/bars (the usage-ring precedent) — no chart-lib dependency — and give every chart
  a TEXT equivalent (the count/figure as text + a direction-aware aria-label), since §9 forbids colour-only
  data.** **Slice 4 (Patterns) is COMPLETE; NEXT: §13.5 per-dream sharing** (per-fact shareable promotion
  into a related person's context, gated by `dreams.shareContext`, excluded for sensitive tiers).
  (Concurrent questionnaire session's main-tree work untouched.)

  [12-dreams](docs/specs/12-dreams.md) §3.5/§4.4/§8.2/§6/§13.4). **Asked first (4 product/UX forks, all
  recommendations confirmed):** recurring-nightmare nudge threshold = **3 nightmares in 14 days** (the
  deterministic backstop; the AI distress signal fires independently); patterns window = a **30d / 90d /
  All-time toggle**; the AI narrative = **on-demand "Generate"** (cached + regenerable, never auto-spends
  budget); Patterns entry = a **"Patterns" button in the Dreams header** → `/dreams/patterns`. Built the
  backend: `@selfos/core/dreams` **`dreamPatternService`** — **`computePatternStats`** (a PURE aggregation
  over `{dream, analysis}[]` → recurring symbols/themes/people/emotions counts, lucid+nightmare counts,
  mood & vividness trend series) + the **`nightmareNudge`** (3-in-14-days OR an AI `distressSignal`,
  computed over the FULL set on a **fixed 14-day window** so a longer view window never dilutes the safety
  signal); `getPatternStats`; **`generatePatternNarrative`** (the budget-gated `dream.patterns` pass over a
  bounded recent-dreams digest → cached as `DreamPatternSummary` at `people/<id>/dreams/patterns.enc`;
  meters before caching; re-gen drops the prior approved Insight); `approvePatternNarrative` (→ a
  **cross-dream `Insight`** `source:'dream'` with **no `dreamId`**, gated by injected `memoryEnabled`);
  `removePatternNarrativeFromContext`. New **crypto-free** view types (`DreamPatternWindow`
  `'30d'|'90d'|'all'`, `DreamPatternStats`, `DreamNarrativeResult`) in `@selfos/core/schemas`;
  `dream.patterns` usage type. IPC seam (gated **`dreams.own`**, dreamer-scoped):
  `dreams:patternStats`/`:getPatternSummary`/`:patternNarrative`/`:approvePatternNarrative`/
  `:removePatternNarrative` (a denied `patternStats` read returns **zeroed stats**, never throws). The API
  key stays host-side. Code-reviewer verdict **ship** (no blockers/should-fixes — nudge decoupling,
  no-`dreamId` Insight, re-gen+remove dropping the Insight, metering-before-cache, and key-host-side all
  verified; applied the one nit so the cached `windowFrom/To` match the digest Claude actually saw). Gate
  green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **156 core + 231 desktop** unit (+11 core
  `dreamPatternService` incl. the windowing + nudge paths, +1 bridge patterns round-trip/gating). On
  `feat/dreams-slice-4a` (in the Dreams worktree). **No user-facing surface, so no E2E/visual-QA** — the
  four `/gallery` chart primitives + the `/dreams/patterns` screen (window toggle, on-demand narrative +
  approve, the nightmare nudge) land in **4b**. (Concurrent questionnaire session's main-tree work
  untouched.)
- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Dreams slice 3c — the guided-analysis UI; §13.3 COMPLETE**;
  [12-dreams](docs/specs/12-dreams.md) §3.2/§3.3/§13.3). The in-pane **Dream ⇄ Analysis** surface.
  **Asked first (3 UX forks, all recommendations confirmed):** presentation = **in-pane mode switch**
  (modal-free, mirroring the questionnaire Edit⇄Preview toggle); post-synthesis = **lead with the card**
  (chat tucks behind a "Continue the conversation" disclosure); editing = **read-first + Edit toggle**.
  A status-aware **Analyze / Resume analysis / View analysis** entry on a saved dream opens
  **`DreamAnalysisPane`** — a guided reflective chat (reuses the Sessions **`Composer` + `CrisisFooter`**
  over a new per-person **`dreamAnalysisStore`** subscribing to `onDreamChunk`) → **"Create analysis"**
  synthesis → the **`DreamSynthesisCard`** (5 read-first sections; Edit → **`DreamAnalysisEditor`** → Save
  via `dreamUpdateAnalysis`). The store **re-approves an already-approved analysis on edit** so the
  coaching context stays in sync (approve is a cheap, **unmetered** local distillation). **Approve** → the
  "in your coaching context" badge + **Remove from context**; Approve is **disabled + hinted when
  `dreams.memoryEnabled` is off**. **Safety:** a `crisisFlag` makes the card **lead with resources**; the
  not-medical line + crisis footer are on every analysis state; symbolic readings stay framed as
  imaginative reflection; AI-off shows a calm connect state, but an **existing** analysis stays
  viewable/editable/approvable offline (only the chat + synthesis need AI). `dreamAnalysisStore.reset()`
  wired into AppShell's active-person effect (per the per-person rule). Both offline fake Claude clients
  (Electron + web preview) now emit a valid synthesis JSON for the "JSON object" turn. Code-reviewer
  **fix-first** (both should-fixes applied: closed a **mobile back-button dead-end** if the selected dream
  vanishes mid-analysis — the list-back now hides only while the pane actually renders; added the missing
  **re-approve-on-edit** test; + an `aria-controls` a11y nit). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib),
  lint, format, **145 core + 230 desktop** unit (+9 RTL: entry label, calm AI-off, guided turn, synthesize,

  screenshots (the card, entry bar, actions, and crisis footer all clean + intentional). On
  `feat/dreams-slice-3c` (in the Dreams worktree). **Lesson: the shared web-preview MCP server is rooted
  at the MAIN tree, so it serves the OTHER worktree's build — for worktree visual QA, capture screenshots
  inside the Playwright run (`w.screenshot`) from the worktree's own build instead.** **Slice 3 (guided
  analysis) is COMPLETE; NEXT: §13.4 Patterns** (deterministic stats + four `/gallery` chart primitives +
  the `dream.patterns` narrative + the recurring-nightmare nudge). (Concurrent questionnaire session's

- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Dreams slice 3b — the analysis IPC seam**;
  [12-dreams](docs/specs/12-dreams.md) §6/§13.3). Wired the slice-3a guided-analysis ops through the typed
  seam (`channels` → `coreBridge` → `ipc` → preload → `test-utils/bridge`), all **gated by `dreams.own`** +
  scoped to the active dreamer (the **bridge is the trust boundary** — inputs Zod-validated; the API key is
  read host-side and **never crosses to the renderer**): `dreams:analyzeTurn` (streams on a **new
  `dreams:chunk` event** via a dedicated `emitDreamChunk`/`onDreamChunk` sink — **separate from the Sessions
  `chat:chunk` stream** so the two never cross; `ipc.ts` binds `event.sender` per turn and resets in
  `finally`, exactly like `chatStream`), `dreams:getAnalysis`/`:getConversation` (resume the chat),
  `dreams:synthesize`, `dreams:updateAnalysis` (save section edits → `edited:true`), `dreams:approve` (the
  host reads `dreams.memoryEnabled` from vault settings — **default ON unless explicitly `false`** — and
  passes it to `approveAnalysis`), `dreams:removeFromContext`. Added a new core **`updateAnalysis`** that
  overwrites only the supplied readable sections (conditional spreads under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`),
  preserving the AI-owned tags/metrics/flags + `insightId` so re-approval refreshes the **same** Insight.
  The two result view types (`DreamSynthesisResult`/`DreamApproveResult`) + the `DreamAnalysisEdits` input
  schema live in the **crypto-free `@selfos/core/schemas`** (the `ChatTurnResult` precedent), so
  `channels.ts` imports them without dragging crypto into the renderer/web tsconfig; the iOS/web `webHost`
  gained the parallel `emitDreamChunk`/`onDreamChunk`. Code-reviewer verdict **ship** (no blockers/
  should-fixes; dreamer-scoping, key-host-side, sender-reset parity, and the `memoryEnabled` default all
  verified). Gate green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **145 core + 221 desktop** unit (+2
  core `updateAnalysis`, +3 bridge: a full analyze→synthesize→edit→approve→remove round-trip, the
  memory-off refusal, and a capability denial). On `feat/dreams-slice-3b` (in the Dreams worktree).
  **No new user-facing surface**, so no E2E/visual-QA this slice — the guided-analysis chat + synthesis
  card + approve UI + the E2E land in **3c**. (The concurrent questionnaire session's `08`/main-tree work
  left untouched; my commit is the 10 seam/test/doc files only.)
- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Dreams slice 3a — core guided-analysis backend**;
  [12-dreams](docs/specs/12-dreams.md) §13.3). The first AI-bearing Dreams code (no IPC/UI yet). New
  **`@selfos/core/dreams` `dreamAnalysisService`**: `runAnalysisTurn` (a **dream-scoped** reflective
  chat — reuses the `05` chat / `06` budget+stream+metering pattern but stores the transcript **under the
  dream** at `dreams/<id>/conversation.enc`, so the Sessions surface never lists it; metered
  **`dream.analyze`**); `synthesizeAnalysis` (one `client.stream` w/ a no-op `onDelta` to get token usage
  → fence-stripping `extractJson` + a Zod-validated **`DreamAnalysisDraftSchema`** → a `DreamAnalysis`;
  marks the dream `analyzed`; **records usage BEFORE parsing** so a paid call whose JSON fails validation
  is still metered; re-synth drops the prior analysis's stale Insight); `approveAnalysis` (→ `Insight`
  `source:'dream'`, `provenance.dreamId`; gated by an **injected `memoryEnabled`** — host reads
  `dreams.memoryEnabled` in 3b; refuses when off); `removeFromContext`; and **`purgeDream`** (delete the
  dream **and** its linked Insight). The blended-**honest** voice lives in `DREAM_ANALYSIS_GUIDANCE` + the
  synthesis contract, reusing `PERSONA`/`SAFETY` (symbolic readings framed as reflection-not-fact;
  `crisisFlag`/`distressSignal`, §8.1/§8.2). Registered the `dream.analyze` usage type; added
  dream-conversation persistence to `dreamService`. Code-reviewer verdict **fix-first** — both
  should-fixes resolved: (#1) the slice-2 bridge delete path orphaned an approved dream Insight (it lives
  OUTSIDE the dream folder, under `people/<id>/insights/`) → now routed through **`purgeDream`**; (#2) a
  paid synthesis call that failed JSON/Zod validation wasn't metered → **`recordUsage` moved ahead of the
  parse**. Nits applied (reuse `DreamTagsSchema`, request `metrics` in the prompt, fence-strip the
  extractor). Gate green: typecheck/lint/format, **143 core + 218 desktop** unit (10 new analysis-service
  tests: transcript-not-in-Sessions, approve→Insight-feeds-context, memory-off refusal, re-synth-drops-
  stale, purge-removes-insight, meter-on-parse-failure, …). On `feat/dreams-slice-3`. **Lesson: when a
  feature stores derived data OUTSIDE the entity's own folder (an `Insight` under `people/<id>/insights/`,
  not under the dream), the entity's delete path must explicitly clean it up — a folder purge alone
  orphans it, and an approved source-discriminated Insight keeps feeding `buildContext` forever.** Next:
  **3b** (IPC seam) → **3c** (guided-chat + synthesis card + approve UI + E2E).
- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Dreams slice 2 — capture + journal UI + nav + settings**;
  [12-dreams](docs/specs/12-dreams.md) §13.2). The first Dreams **renderer** surface (no AI yet — pure
  journaling works offline). IPC seam `dreams:list/get/save/delete` through the typed seam
  (`channels` → `coreBridge` → `ipc` → preload), **gated by `dreams.own`** + **scoped to the active
  dreamer** (mirrors conversations); main owns id/`schemaVersion`/`personId`/`status`/timestamps and
  merges over an existing dream on edit (preserves `createdAt`/analysis link). New `DreamInputSchema`
  (renderer-supplied; booleans/collections default so a narrative-only dump is valid). Renderer: a
  `dreamStore` with a per-person **`reset()`** wired into AppShell's active-person reset+reload effect
  (the per-person-isolation rule — dreams must not leak across a switch); a **Dreams** master–detail
  journal; a narrative-first **`DreamComposer`** (lucid/nightmare `Switch` toggles + optional
  mood/vividness/sleep/date + tags/people via a reusable **`ChipEditor`** + sensitivity; Save gated on a
  non-empty narrative; delete behind a confirm); the `/dreams` nav entry (moon icon, `dreams.own`-gated)
  - route; and the **`dreams.memoryEnabled`** vault setting in a new Dreams settings section.
    **People-graph linking of "people present" deferred** (free-name chips for now); the **Analyze** entry
    point + all AI land in slice 3 (no scaffolding here, §12). Tests: +1 coreBridge dreams test
    (CRUD + per-dreamer scoping + Guest-denied), 5 Dreams RTL (empty/list/capture-payload/save-gating/
    delete-confirm), +1 E2E (capture → encrypted round-trip → reopen + overflow guard) + Dreams added to
    the **390px sweep**. Visual QA done from the live app at desktop + 390px (master–detail; the
    optional-details grid stacks on phones). Gate green: typecheck/lint/format, **133 core + 217 desktop**
    unit, E2E. Built on **`feat/dreams-slice-2`** (stacked on slice 1) in the isolated worktree — the
    concurrent questionnaires session (`feat/questionnaire-ai-generate`, §13.3) untouched. **NOTE: the
    shared seam files (`channels`/`coreBridge`/`ipc`/preload) + `CLAUDE.md` will conflict-merge with that
    session's work — both append; trivial to resolve.** Next: **slice 3** (guided analysis → approve →
    context).
- 2026-06-11 — Spec + Build (**Dreams** — new spec [12-dreams](docs/specs/12-dreams.md) drafted, approved,
  and **slice 1 built**; §13.1). Dreams = guided AI dream journaling + analysis + cross-dream patterns; the
  **third producer** into `08`'s shared Insight/metrics layer (a dream's **approved** analysis becomes an
  `Insight` `source:'dream'` feeding `buildContext` — no new context plumbing). Spec written ask-first (16
  decisions / 4 rounds + a 5-Q review): blended **honest** voice (evidence + symbolic, framed as reflection
  not fact), **guide→synthesize** chat (reuses `05`, stored **under the dream**, kept OUT of the Sessions
  list), structured 5-section analysis, **approve-gate** before context, per-dream sharing (off by default),
  per-dream `SensitivityTier`, dreamer-only + super-admin break-glass (**no audit log v1**), **full
  cross-dream patterns in v1** (hybrid stats + view-only AI narrative w/ opt-in add-to-context),
  recurring-nightmare nudge (**count OR AI distress signal**). **Image generation deferred to a future
  companion spec** (2nd provider/OpenAI, consent, **binary-blob vault storage**, per-image cost) — no
  scaffolding here. UX reviewed via interactive mockups of the 4 surfaces before approval. **Slice 1
  (backend/core):** the `Dream`/`DreamPersonRef`/`DreamStatus`/`DreamTags`/`DreamAnalysis`/
  `DreamPatternSummary` schemas; the **additive** `Insight` `source:'dream'` + `provenance.dreamId`
  amendment (**no migration** — additive-optional, `schemaVersion` stays 1; synced into `08`);
  `dreams.own`/`dreams.shareContext` capabilities (Member default; **no view-others'-dreams** capability);
  and **`@selfos/core/dreams`** `dreamService` (encrypted per-dream-folder CRUD over Dream+DreamAnalysis;
  **delete purges the folder**; listing skips non-dream sidecars like `patterns.enc` + enforces dreamer
  scoping, mirroring `insightStore`). Code-reviewed (verdict **ship**; fixed: `DreamPersonRef` now forbids
  an empty `{}` ref; added a populated round-trip + a Zod-bounds-rejection test). Gate green:
  typecheck/lint/format, **133 core + 211 desktop** unit (no E2E — backend-only, no new surface).
  **Process:** the approved spec committed (`99e3264`) but **landed on `main`** because a concurrent
  questionnaires session switched the shared HEAD mid-session (moving it onto a branch is deferred per the
  user); slice 1 was then built in an **isolated git worktree** (`feat/dreams-slice-1` off the spec commit)
  so the live questionnaires session (`feat/questionnaire-ai-generate`, doing §13.3) was untouched.
  **Lesson: with a concurrent agent in a SHARED working tree, switching branches moves the one shared HEAD
  — use a separate `git worktree` for feature work to avoid disrupting the other session, and re-check
  `git branch --show-current` immediately before any commit.** **Next §13 slices:** capture + journal UI +
  settings + nav (2) → guided analysis (3) → patterns (4) → per-dream sharing (5).
- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **slice 2 — question images** [§13.2 last leaf; **§13.2 now
  complete**], [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §4.1/§4.2/§5.1/§6/§8.6/§13.2). Asked
  first (3 Qs): storage = **shared media dir** `questionnaires/media/<id>.enc`; picker = **in-renderer
  `<input type=file>`** (base64 over IPC — portable to web/iOS, no native dialog); limits = **~5 MB,
  PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF**. Decided (not asked): **alt text required** (a11y), one image/question, image renders
  under prompt/help in builder + form, `media` gains **`mime`** (additive, no migration), relay ZK
  re-encryption deferred to §13.6. Built: core **`imageService`** (encrypted CRUD in the shared dir) over
  **new byte-level `encryptBytes`/`decryptBytes`** — the string `encrypt`/`decrypt` now **wrap** them so the
  on-disk envelope is byte-identical (vaults stay readable; `cryptoCompat` fixture green). IPC
  `questionnaires:storeImage`/`:getImage`/`:deleteImage` gated by `questionnaires.create`, **mime + ≤5 MB
  re-validated in main** (the renderer's check isn't the trust boundary), and an **`isMediaPath` guard**
  confines reads/deletes to the media dir (a malicious renderer can't `getImage('config/recovery.enc')`).
  Builder: thumbnail + required-alt field; the shared `QuestionnaireForm` takes a **`loadImage`** prop (relay
  will supply its own decrypt). Code-reviewer **fix-first** (applied both): the attach flow no longer
  **swallows errors** (surfaces a message), and **remove no longer eagerly deletes the vault file** — it only
  clears the draft, so an unsaved "remove" discards cleanly with no dangling reference, and the orphan is
  reaped by a later GC. Live web-preview QA of the full encrypt→IndexedDB→decrypt→display round-trip at
  desktop + 390px. Gate green: typecheck/lint/format, **211 desktop** + **123 core** unit, **32 E2E** (new
  attach→alt→round-trip→preview). **Lesson: a caller-supplied vault path from the renderer is untrusted —
  any read/delete-by-path IPC must confine the path (prefix + suffix + no `..`) in MAIN, never the
  renderer.** **Deferred:** orphan-image GC + purge-on-questionnaire-delete (§3.9); image-into-send-snapshot

    §4.1/§4.2/§5.1/§6/§13.2 + changelog. **§13.2 builder follow-ups are DONE; next is §13.3 (AI generate +
    context-provider registry) or §13.4/§13.5.**
- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **slice 2 — preview / test-on-self** [§13.2], the **shared answering
  renderer**, [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §3.1/§5.1/§5.3/§8.2/§13.2). Asked first
  (4 Qs): presentation = **in-pane Edit ⇄ Preview toggle** (not a modal — the app is modal-free; avoids a
  new focus-trapped primitive); **one interactive preview** (live branching + required, nothing saved);
  **all 12 answer-type controls now**; **ephemeral "nothing was saved"** confirmation on Finish. I also
  recommended (spec-backed, §8.2) that preview **shows the crisis footer + not-medical line** — reusing the
  existing `CrisisFooter`. Built: **`QuestionnaireForm`** (the renderer the Inbox + relay will reuse) — 12
  controls (radio/checkbox choice, yes-no/this-or-that pills, rating/matrix min→max scale, slider, ranking
  with ↑/↓, allocation with a live `/100` hint, date), driven by a new **pure core helper**
  `@selfos/core/questionnaires` **`answering`** (`isQuestionVisible`/`visibleQuestions`/`isAnswered`/
  `unansweredRequired`/`allocationTotal`) so the branching/required logic is DOM-free + reused; plus
  **`QuestionnairePreview`** (Finish gating → ephemeral result) and the builder toggle. **No new IPC** —
  pure renderer + a core helper; preview persists nothing + produces no Insight. Slider/ranking **seed once
  on mount** (min / authored order) so an untouched control still reads as answered; allocation clamps to
  ≥ 0. Live web-preview visual QA of all 12 controls at desktop + 390px (matrix label stacks above its
  scale on phones — clean). Reviewer verdict **ship** (no blockers/should-fixes; applied one clamp nit). Gate
  green: typecheck/lint/format, **208 desktop** + **115 core** unit (+11 `answering`, +7 form/preview RTL,
  +1 builder toggle), **31 E2E** (new preview flow; the 390px sweep now opens Preview). **Lesson: the
  renderer can import runtime helpers from `@selfos/core/questionnaires` directly (first value-import of that
  barrel into the renderer) — it bundles via the web host + crypto is already DOM-lib-safe (`bufferSource`),
  so tree-shaking keeps just the pure `answering` fns.** **Still deferred (§13.2):** question-image attach
  editor (needs encrypted media storage + IPC). Built **in-place**; physically extracted to a shared package
  when the relay (§13.6) needs it. Synced `08` §3.1/§5.1/§5.3/§13.2 + changelog.
- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **slice 2 — builder authoring editors** [§13.2 follow-ups],
  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §3.1/§4.1/§6/§13.2). Asked first (4 Qs): scope =
  **authoring editors only** (images + preview/test-on-self deferred to their own slices); custom types =
  **persisted registry**; sensitivity = **picker + author note, gates deferred** to send/relay; branching
  triggers = **discrete answers only** (singleChoice/yesNo). Built: a **sensitivity picker** (4
  `SensitivityTier` tiers; a sensitive tier shows a calm author note — the 18+/DOB/consent gates stay
  recipient-side at send per §3.2/§8.3, **not scaffolded here**), a **matrix** rows+scale editor, **help
  text** + **scale low/high labels**, a **branching editor** ("show this question when an earlier
  single-choice/yes-no answer = value"; **staleness-pruned** in `resolveBranch` so a branch the UI has
  hidden — trigger deleted / no longer discrete / chosen option cleared or renamed — never persists), and
  **persisted custom types**: new core **`customTypeService`** (`listCustomTypes`/`addCustomType` over the
  **plain** `config/questionnaires.json` prefs file + `QuestionnairePrefsSchema`, matching the
  `config/settings.json` plain precedent), exposed via new IPC **`questionnaires:listTypes`/`:addType`**
  through the seam (channels → coreBridge → ipc → preload → store), gated by **`questionnaires.create`**.
  Code-reviewer caught two real misses (fixed): a **test-only `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` typecheck failure
  the green Vitest run masked** (esbuild doesn't enforce the flag — **re-run `pnpm typecheck` after adding
  tests, not just `pnpm test`**), and a **branch that could persist after its trigger lost the chosen
  option** (UI hid it but `resolveBranch` still emitted it). Live web-preview visual QA at desktop + 390px
  caught + fixed a **Type-select + "New type" button overflow** (`.metaRow > * { min-width: 0 }`). Gate
  green: typecheck/lint/format, **200 desktop** + **104 core** unit (+1 staleness RTL, +1 core service, +1
  coreBridge gating test), **30 E2E** (new custom-type/sensitivity/matrix/branching round-trip; the 390px
  sweep now exercises matrix + new-type + branch). Renderer + a thin core service. **Lesson: the Vitest
  run does NOT typecheck (esbuild strips types) — `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`/strict-optional errors in
  test files slip through unless you run `pnpm typecheck` after writing tests.** **Still deferred (§13.2):**
  question-image attach editor, preview/test-on-self. Synced `08` §3.1/§5.1/§6/§13.2 + changelog.
- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **slice 2 — the builder UI**,
  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §3/§13.2): the first renderer surface — a
  **Questionnaires** master-detail screen (list + builder pane, mirroring People), gated by
  **`questionnaires.create`**, with a **`questionnaireStore`** (Zustand: load/save/remove/validate,
  re-fetching after mutations) over the `window.selfos.questionnaires*` IPC. The **builder** authors
  title + type (taxonomy Select) + a question list — each with a prompt, an answer-type Select (11
  authorable types; matrix/branching/images deferred), a Required toggle, an **options editor** for
  choice/ranking/allocation (stable `{id,text}[]` model so edits never steal focus), and a min/max
  **scale editor** (rating/slider). "Check" runs the engine's `validate` + a client-side guard; scale
  bounds are **coerced finite at the input boundary** so a cleared field can't persist `NaN`
  (code-reviewer caught the `z.number()`-accepts-`NaN` edge). Nav entry + `/questionnaires` route in

- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **IPC/bridge wiring** — exposing the engine to the renderer,
  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §6/§13.2): added `questionnaires:list/get/save/
delete/validate` + `assignments:create` (in-app) through the typed seam — `channels.ts` (contract +
  `SelfosBridge`) → **`coreBridge`** (host-agnostic, so the iOS host gets it free) → `ipc.ts` handlers →
  preload. All gated by **`questionnaires.create`** (`validate` is an ungated pure pre-flight check);
  `assignments:create` is **in-app/household only** for now (forces `channel: inApp` + a household-person
  recipient; the relay channel + answer/results/insights IPC land with their slices). Renderer inputs are
  Zod-validated in the bridge. Code-reviewed (added a recipient-existence check so a send can't bind a
  phantom recipient; `expiresAt` tightened to a datetime). Gate green (typecheck/lint/format, **191
  desktop** + 98 core unit tests). Synced `08` §6/§13.2.
- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **slice 1b — the questionnaire engine backend**,
  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §4.2/§4.3/§13.1): the `Questionnaire`/`Question`
  (all answer types incl. matrix/allocation + author `media` + simple `branch`)/`Assignment`/`ResponseSet`
  Zod schemas + the new **`@selfos/core/questionnaires`** services — `questionnaireService` (CRUD +
  **version-bump-on-edit** + `validateQuestionnaire`), `assignmentService` (`createAssignment` freezes an
  **immutable snapshot** of the as-sent questionnaire + refuses an invalid send; status transitions incl.
  decline-with-note; sender-scoped list), `responseService` (encrypted response CRUD + re-ask chaining).
  Code-reviewed (no blockers; added per-answer-type validation tests + a stray-`sends/`-entry regression);

  context-provider registry, `queryMetrics`, and the renderer (IPC + builder/inbox/results UI). Synced `08`

- 2026-06-11 — Build (Questionnaires **slice 1a — the shared Insight/metrics layer foundation**,
  [08-questionnaires](docs/specs/08-questionnaires.md) §4.4/§13): added the `Insight`/`InsightFact`/
  `InsightSource` Zod schemas, the new **`@selfos/core/insights`** `insightStore` (encrypted per-subject
  CRUD + `summarizeForContext` — own approved insights + related people's shareable facts, recency-capped),
  and wired it into **`buildContext`**. Registered `questionnaires.create/answer/viewResults/sendExternal`
  (Member gets all four); **`readRaw` intentionally NOT registered** (deferred to the break-glass slice;
  ships OFF even for the Owner). Added optional `email`/`phone` to `Person`/`PersonInput`
  (additive-optional — **no `schemaVersion` bump/migration**, matching the `DeviceStateSchema` precedent);
  `upsertPerson` persists them (the code-reviewer caught it dropping them). Gate green (typecheck/lint/

- 2026-06-11 — Fix (**per-person session isolation — the previous account's sessions lingered in the UI
  after a switch**; user flagged). Diagnosed (not guessed): conversation **storage is correctly
  per-person** (`people/<personId>/conversations/*.enc`; `listConversations` only reads that person's dir)
  — the leak was **stale renderer state**. `sessionStore.switchTo` reloaded only the session store; the
  **person-scoped stores (`conversationStore`, `budgetStore`, `usageStore`) were never reset**, so after
  switching, the prior account's Sessions list / open transcript / usage-ring lingered until some later
  `load()` ("disappears after a little bit" — e.g. navigating to Sessions re-ran its mount-effect). Fix:
  each store gets a `reset()`, and **`AppShell` runs an effect keyed on `activePerson.id`** that
  resets all three + reloads conversations/budget — so a switch clears the UI immediately, even while the
  Sessions screen stays mounted (the bug's trigger: switching via the always-visible TopBar account menu).
  Also resets the admin's "view person X" usage filter so it can't carry into another account. Unit tests
  for the three resets + an **E2E** (owner creates a renamed session → grant a member → switch to them
  while on Sessions → the owner's session is gone, `toHaveCount(0)`). **Lesson: any renderer store holding
  PER-PERSON data must reset when `activePerson.id` changes — storage scoping alone isn't enough; stale
  client state leaks one user's data into another's view. Household-wide stores (people, settings) and
  device-scoped ones (nav) are exempt.** Gates: typecheck/lint/format, 188 desktop unit (+3), **28 E2E**
  (+1). Renderer-only. **NOTE: a concurrent agent is now editing `packages/core` (capabilities/schemas/
  peopleService/buildContext + a new `insights/` dir — their session-analysis track) — all UNCOMMITTED;
  left untouched, my commit is the 5 renderer files only.**
- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Capacitor track slice iii-b3b — live vault change feed**;
  [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.4/§13). Closes the last deferred iii item. The
  existing `VaultFs` plugin gains a private **`NSFilePresenter`** watching the vault directory →
  `notifyListeners("vaultChanged")` (fires when iCloud applies a sync from another device), plus
  `startWatch`/`stopWatch` (methods on the **already-registered** plugin — the user just rebuilds, no
  Add-Files). TS: `VaultFsPlugin` gains `startWatch`/`stopWatch`/`addListener`; `webHost`'s
  `createBridgeHost` gains an `onVaultChanged` part — `createCapacitorHost` arms the native watch from the
  active bookmark + forwards events, the web preview stays a no-op. Reviewer-driven robustness:
  **disarm on background / re-arm on foreground + `deinit`** (so a suspended app never holds a coordination
  presenter or leaks the security scope), and the TS watcher re-checks a `cancelled` flag after each await
  (no listener/watch leak if cleanup races setup). **Honesty caveat:** the only consumer (`useVaultConflicts`
  → `getConflicts`) is **still a stub on iOS** (`getConflicts` returns `[]`), so the feed is wired + correct
  but yields **no visible conflict banner on iPhone yet** — iOS conflict _detection_ is a separate deferred
  piece; the presenter is the seam for it + future live data re-fetch. Reviewer verdict **ship**. Gates:
  typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **261 unit** (76 core + 185 desktop, +2 watcher tests),
  `build:web`. **Swift blind** — user rebuilds (no Add-Files) + device-tests a background→foreground cycle.
  **Lesson: an iOS `NSFilePresenter`/held security scope MUST be torn down on app-background (and re-armed
  on foreground) — a suspended app holding one can block coordinated writes + leak the scope.** **The iii
  arc is now fully done** (a/b1/b2/b3/b3b + c1/c2); only iii-d (wife's-phone install, Xcode-only) + (iv)
  distribution remain, both user-driven. (Concurrent agent's `docs/specs/0{4,5,8,9}` + `11` untouched.)
- 2026-06-11 — Fix + **Capacitor track wrap-up (iOS app layer COMPLETE, on-device verified)**;
  [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §13. Security cleanup: **`scrubLegacyLocalStorageSecrets()`**
  (`host/webStores.ts`) removes the orphaned master key + API key the pre-iii-c1 stub left in WKWebView
  `localStorage` (now that secrets live in the Keychain — lower-protection duplicate). It runs **only in
  `installRealBridge`'s native branch** (iOS); the web preview keeps its `localStorage` secrets. Regex
  `^selfos:[^:]*:secret:` matches secret keys only (device-state/settings + non-app keys are left). +1
  test. **Decision (asked):** security cleanup + finalize, over the optional iii-b3b live-refresh polish.
  **Milestone:** the user verified the full app on a physical iPhone — shared iCloud vault (with
  download-on-demand), Keychain secrets (one-time re-unlock), and **real streamed Claude**. So the iOS app
  layer (iii-a → iii-c) is **done**: one responsive codebase running on Electron + iPhone off the **same**
  iCloud-Drive vault via `createCoreBridge` over platform hosts. Gates: typecheck/lint/format, **259 unit**
  (76 core + 183 desktop), `build:web`. (Self-reviewed — small, iOS-gated, tested cleanup.) **Remaining,
  non-blocking:** **iii-b3b** live `NSFilePresenter` change feed (`onVaultChanged` is a no-op; reads are
  fresh anyway), **iii-d** wife's-phone install (Xcode signing only, no code), **(iv)** Developer Program +
  TestFlight. (Concurrent agent's `docs/specs/0{4,5,8,9}` + `11` still untouched.)
- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Capacitor track slice iii-c2 — real Claude on iOS**;
  [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.3/§11.3/§13). Replaces the fake assistant on
  iOS with the Anthropic SDK in **browser mode**. New `host/browserClaudeClient.ts` — the
  `@anthropic-ai/sdk` with **`dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`** running in the WKWebView, a faithful mirror
  of the Electron `anthropicClient` (adaptive thinking + `cache_control` on the system prefix, streamed
  `on('text')` deltas, usage-field mapping). `webHost`'s `createBridgeHost` gained a `claude` part:
  `createWebHost` keeps the deterministic fake (preview), `createCapacitorHost` uses the real browser
  client. **No native-HTTP fallback yet** — per spec §11.3 it's only built if WKWebView blocks CORS/SSE on
  the user's device (browser-mode tried first). **Probe result: the SDK typechecks under the DOM lib AND
  bundles into `build:web`** (151 KB gzip total, +42 KB; advisory chunk-size warning only) — so browser-mode
  is viable. Security: the API key is read from the Keychain and passed to the SDK per call; on iOS the host
  runs in the WebView, so the key is transiently in JS memory during the call (inherent to Capacitor; the
  native-HTTP fallback would keep it native). Reviewer verdict **ship** (parity with `anthropicClient`
  verified line-for-line + against the SDK 0.104.1 `Usage` type; no leaks/logging). Gates: typecheck, lint,
  format, **258 unit** (76 core + 182 desktop, +3 SDK-mocked tests), `build:web`. **The browser-mode network
  path is verified ON-DEVICE by the user** (can't unit/E2E the real API). **This completes the iii-c app
  layer — iOS now has the real iCloud FS (VaultFs) + Keychain secrets + real Claude.** **NEXT: the user's
  on-device chat test** — if it hits a WKWebView CORS/SSE error, build the native-HTTP fallback (CapacitorHttp
  or a small plugin); else **iii-b3b** (live NSFilePresenter change feed) / **iii-d** (wife's phone install).
  (Concurrent agent's `docs/specs/0{4,5,8,9}` + `11` untouched.)
- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Capacitor track slice iii-c1 — native iOS Keychain `SecretStore`**;
  [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.1/§5.3/§13). Moves the vault **master key + Claude
  API key** off the iii-b2 `localStorage` stub into the **iOS Keychain**. New `ios/App/App/Keychain.swift`
  (`CAPBridgedPlugin` `jsName "Keychain"`, registered alongside `VaultFs` in `MainViewController`):
  `get`/`set`(upsert via SecItemUpdate→Add)/`has`/`remove` over `kSecClassGenericPassword`, service = bundle
  id, **`kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`, not synced**, settle-once on every path. TS
  `host/capacitorSecretStore.ts` (`capacitorSecretStore(plugin?)` → core `SecretStore`); `webHost`'s
  `createBridgeHost` now takes a `secrets` part — `createWebHost` keeps `localStorage` (preview),
  `createCapacitorHost` uses the Keychain. **Decision (asked):** Keychain first, then real Claude (iii-c2).
  **Migration:** a device that unlocked under the old `localStorage` stub re-unlocks **once** via recovery
  phrase (gate routes `vaultInitialized && !hasMasterKey` → Unlock; no re-key, no lockout, recovery phrase
  still held) — no blind migration written (reviewer confirmed safe). Reviewer verdict **ship** (no
  blockers; Keychain query/upsert/error-handling correct, TS adapter faithful + tested). Gates: typecheck
  (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **255 unit** (76 core + 179 desktop, +5 adapter tests), `build:web`.
  **Swift is blind** — user adds `Keychain.swift` to the App target + rebuilds (re-unlock once after).
  **Lesson: each new app-local Capacitor plugin needs its own `registerPluginInstance` line in
  `MainViewController.capacitorDidLoad` — that's now the established pattern (`VaultFs`, `Keychain`, and the
  iii-c2 Claude/HTTP plugin if any).** Backlog: scrub the legacy `localStorage` secret keys post-migration.
  **NEXT: iii-c2** real Claude (browser-mode SDK + native-HTTP fallback). (Concurrent agent's
  `docs/specs/0{4,5,8,9}` + `11` untouched.)
- 2026-06-11 — Fix (**iOS WebView stuck-zoom — content didn't fit, scrolled both axes**; user flagged on
  their device). Diagnosed from the device (NOT guessed): an on-device console probe showed `vw=319`
  while the page layout + every element was **393** (the iPhone's logical width) — i.e. the layout was
  correct and fit, but the WKWebView was **zoomed ~1.23×** so only 319 of the 393 showed → scroll in both
  axes, on every screen (the zoom persists across in-app navigation). **Cause:** iOS auto-zooms a WebView
  when an `<input>` with font < 16px is focused (1.23 ≈ 16/13 — the unlock PIN field), and the viewport
  meta didn't lock scaling so it never zoomed back. **Fix:** added `maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no`
  to the viewport meta in `apps/desktop/index.html` (the web/iOS entry; Electron uses its own html, so it's
  unaffected). It's an app shell, not a web page — locking scale is standard for a Capacitor WebView, and
  system-level Accessibility → Zoom still works. **Lesson: the E2E 390px overflow guard can't catch this —
  it's a real-device WebView zoom behavior (insets/auto-zoom are 0/absent in jsdom + the browser preview).
  On-device, measure `window.innerWidth` vs `documentElement.scrollWidth`: a mismatch = a zoom problem, a
  match-but-too-wide = a layout overflow.** (Web-only change; rebuild via `build:web` → `cap sync` → Xcode.
  Concurrent agent's `docs/specs/0{4,5,8,9}` + `11` untouched.)
- 2026-06-11 — Fix (**iCloud download-on-demand in `VaultFs`** — user hit it doing the shared-vault test).
  Symptom: the phone pointed at the **same** iCloud `SelfOS` folder the Mac set up, but still showed
  **Setup** instead of Unlock. Cause: on a fresh device the Mac's files are iCloud **placeholders**
  (`.recovery.enc.icloud`) until downloaded, and v1 `VaultFs` checked `fileExists` on the real name →
  `false` → `read('config/recovery.enc')` returned null → `isVaultInitialized` false → Setup. (Worse,
  `initVault`'s placeholder-blind meta read had rewritten the vault's `.selfos/meta.json` + empty
  `settings.json` — cosmetic; `recovery.enc` + `people/*.enc` were never touched, so unlock still works.)
  This is the §7/Q8 edge we'd deferred — turns out it's required for the **very first cross-device read**.
  Fix (Swift, `ios/App/App/VaultFs.swift`): `read` now **materializes a not-yet-downloaded item on demand**
  — if the real file is absent but a `.<name>.icloud` placeholder exists, call
  `startDownloadingUbiquitousItem` + poll (bounded 30s, off the main thread) before the coordinated read;
  genuinely-absent (no placeholder) still → null. `list` maps `.<real>.icloud` placeholder names back to
  real names. **Lesson: on iCloud Drive, `fileExists`/`contentsOfDirectory` reflect only _downloaded_
  state — any cross-device read must trigger `startDownloadingUbiquitousItem` and handle the
  `.<name>.icloud` placeholder, or a synced-but-not-downloaded vault reads as empty.** Swift-only (TS gates
  unaffected); user rebuilds in Xcode (no `cap sync` needed — the file's already in the target). Still open
  (Q8): the richer "downloading from iCloud…" progress UX, and eviction/delete of not-downloaded files.
  (Concurrent agent's `docs/specs/0{4,5,8,9}` + `11` untouched.)
- 2026-06-11 — Fix + **iii-b3 verified on-device** (user built it in Xcode). The native `VaultFs` plugin
  was compiling but **not registered** — `Capacitor.isPluginAvailable('VaultFs')` was `false`, so
  `pickFolder()` rejected and our `selectVaultFolder` catch swallowed it to null → tapping "Choose a
  folder" did nothing. **Cause + lesson: app-local Capacitor plugins are NOT auto-discovered** — only
  plugins shipped as packages (with a podspec) are. An in-app Swift plugin must be **registered
  explicitly**. Fix: added `ios/App/App/MainViewController.swift` (a `CAPBridgeViewController` subclass)
  that calls `bridge?.registerPluginInstance(VaultFsPlugin())` in `capacitorDidLoad`, and repointed
  `Main.storyboard`'s root VC to `MainViewController`. After re-adding both Swift files to the App target
  (Reference in place) + rebuild: `isPluginAvailable` → true, the iOS folder picker presents, and setup
  writes the encrypted vault through `VaultFs` on the simulator. **So the iii-c Keychain plugin (and any
  future native plugin) needs the same `registerPluginInstance` line in `MainViewController`.** Diagnosis
  tip: the Safari Web Inspector console (Develop → simulator → the app) + `Capacitor.isPluginAvailable(...)`
  is the fastest way to tell "plugin not registered" from "plugin errored". (Native-only change; TS gates
  unaffected. Concurrent agent's `docs/specs/0{4,5,8,9}` + `11` still untouched.)
- 2026-06-11 — Build (**Capacitor track slice iii-b3 — native Swift `VaultFs` plugin + TS FS adapter**;
  [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.4/§13). The **real security-scoped iCloud-Drive
  filesystem for iOS**, so the iOS WebView shares the _same_ vault as desktop. **`ios/App/App/VaultFs.swift`**
  (`CAPBridgedPlugin`): `pickFolder` (UIDocumentPicker open-directory → a security-scoped bookmark),
  bookmark resolve, and `read`/`writeAtomic`(temp+rename via `Data(.atomic)`)/`list`/`remove` over
  `NSFileCoordinator`, each bracketed in `start/stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource` and settling its
  `CAPPluginCall` **exactly once after coordination**. TS: **`host/capacitorVaultFs.ts`**
  (`registerPlugin('VaultFs')` + `capacitorFileSystem(bookmark, plugin?)` over the core `FileSystem`, bytes
  base64-bridged via a new **`@selfos/core/encoding`** export); **`webHost` refactored** to a shared
  `createBridgeHost(parts)` used by both `createWebHost` (IndexedDB) and `createCapacitorHost` (native FS +
  picker, reusing the iii-b2 `localStorage` stores); **`installRealBridge` now picks the host by
  `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`**. **Decisions (asked):** **defer the NSFilePresenter** change feed to a
  iii-b3b follow-up (`onVaultChanged` no-op for now); **reuse `localStorage`** for interim iOS
  device-state/secrets (only the FileSystem swaps to native; iii-c brings the Keychain). No
  iCloud-container entitlement (access is via security scope — §11.6). Reviewer verdict **ship**; applied
  the should-fixes — restructured all 4 Swift coordinated ops to **settle the call once after `coordinate`
  returns** (a hung call would freeze boot — the worst on-device failure), and made `createCapacitorHost`
  **injectable + tested** (picker→bookmark + cancel→null). Gates green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint,
  format, **250 unit** (76 core + 174 desktop, +6 TS host tests), **27 Electron E2E** (no regression),
  `pnpm build:web` bundles `@capacitor/core`. **The Swift is BLIND-WRITTEN — I can't compile it here; the
  user builds + verifies on-device in Xcode** (`pnpm build:web` → `npx cap sync ios` → **add `VaultFs.swift`
  to the App target's Compile Sources** → run; expect to iterate on any Swift compile nits). **Lesson: for a
  blind-written native bridge method, the #1 robustness rule is "settle the platform call exactly once on
  every path" — an unsettled `CAPPluginCall`/promise hangs the JS caller (here: a frozen boot with no
  error).** **NEXT: iii-c** (iOS Keychain `SecretStore` + browser-mode Claude with a native-HTTP fallback),
  then **iii-b3b** (the live NSFilePresenter change feed). **(Concurrent agent's `docs/specs/0{4,5,8,9}` +
  `11` left untouched; this slice's doc edits are only 07 + this entry.)**
- 2026-06-10 — Build (**Capacitor track slice iii-b2 — iOS in-webview host + browser verification**;
  [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.3/§13). The real **in-webview `BridgeHost`**
  wiring the shared `createCoreBridge` factory to browser APIs, so the actual `@selfos/core` runs in a
  WKWebView/web preview (replacing the throwaway iii-a stub). New `renderer/src/host/`: **`idbFileSystem`**
  (IndexedDB `FileSystem` — vault-relative paths keyed `<vaultId>/<path>`, atomic per-tx writes + subtree
  removes), **`webStores`** (`localStorage` SecretStore + device state/settings **namespaced by a `?device=`
  id** so two tabs = two devices sharing one vault, + a deterministic fake `ClaudeClient`), **`webHost`**
  (assembles the host + boot/`useVault`/`initVault` over IDB + `installRealBridge()`). `main.web.tsx` calls
  `installRealBridge()`; **`stubBridge.ts` deleted**. `DeviceStateSchema` gained optional `vaultBookmark?`
  (the iOS vault handle; the web host uses it as the IDB vault id). **Decisions (asked):** IndexedDB-backed
  preview vault (persistent), deterministic fake Claude reply, and **yes to the `?device=` multi-device
  switch** (recommended — it's the one risky path: redeem with NO device key). **Browser-verified** the real
  app end-to-end: onboarding → real WebCrypto/scrypt `householdSetup` → people → invite → a `?device=B` tab
  reading the shared IndexedDB vault + redeeming the invite with no prior key (joins **member-only**, not
  owner) → capability-gated nav (member's nav omits People) → chat streaming, no console errors. Reviewer
  verdict **ship** (added a `webHost` boot/initVault test + made `idbFileSystem.remove` single-transaction
  per the findings). Gates green: typecheck (node + web/DOM-lib), lint, format, **244 unit** (76 core + 168
  desktop, incl. 16 new host tests via `fake-indexeddb`), **27 Electron E2E** (no regression),
  `pnpm build:web` bundles `@selfos/core` (105 KB gzip). **Lesson: `fake-indexeddb`'s tx scheduler needs
  `setImmediate` (node env, not jsdom), and a shared global IDB deadlocks across tests when a prior open
  connection blocks `deleteDatabase` — inject a fresh `IDBFactory` per test (as `idbFileSystem` already
  did).** The web host is the same one the iOS WebView will use until the native plugins land. **NEXT:
  iii-b3** — the Swift `VaultFs` Capacitor plugin (real security-scoped iCloud FS) replaces `idbFileSystem`;
  then iii-c (iOS Keychain + browser-mode Claude) replaces the `localStorage`/fake stubs. **(Concurrent
  agent's `docs/specs/0{4,5,8,9}` + `11` left untouched; this slice's only doc edits are 07 + this entry.)**
- 2026-06-10 — Build (**Capacitor track slice iii-b1 — shared `createCoreBridge(host)` factory + Electron
  migration**; [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.3/§13). Extracted ONE
  platform-agnostic factory (`apps/desktop/src/shared/coreBridge.ts`, node/electron/`Buffer`-free) that
  implements the ~30 `SelfosBridge` data ops **once** over an injected **`BridgeHost`** of platform
  primitives (`vaultAndKey`/`fileSystem`/`secrets`/`claude`/device-state/device-settings/`activeModel`/
  super-admin flag/`emitChatChunk`/`appVersion` + the forwarded platform ops). Electron's `ipc.ts` now
  builds a node-backed host, calls the factory, and registers each `ipcMain.handle` as a **thin delegate**
  (via a typed `handle<F>` helper); platform-specific ops (folder picker, chokidar watcher, conflicts,
  reveal, boot-state) stay in the host, and `useVault`/`chatStream` are special-cased to capture
  `event.sender` (the chat sender is bound per-turn + reset in `finally`). Supporting moves:
  `runConnectionTest`/`mapError` → **`shared/claudeProxy.ts`** (deleted `main/claude/claudeService.ts`,
  only `anthropicClient` stays in main); `main/settings/settingsStore.ts` slimmed to **device-only** (vault
  settings now read/written in the factory over the FileSystem host — `readVaultSettingsValues`);
  `main/people/superAdmin.ts` slimmed to **just the in-memory inspect flag** (passphrase set/has/verify +
  the legacy device→vault migration moved into the factory via `@selfos/core/people`); **deleted
  `main/people/household.ts` + `session.ts`** (householdStatus/setupHousehold + active-person now in the
  factory over `host.readDeviceState`/`updateDeviceState`); core gains a `./id` export + re-exports
  `memFileSystem`. **Behavior-preserving** — the suite is the proof, and inputs are still **Zod-validated in
  the factory** so the trust boundary holds on BOTH hosts (the renderer is never the boundary); the API key
  stays host-side. Reviewer verdict **ship** (exact IPC channel parity; every moved handler logically
  identical to the old `ipc.ts`). Gates green: typecheck (incl. `tsconfig.web` DOM lib — the factory imports
  `@selfos/core/crypto`), lint, format, **228 unit** (76 core + 152 desktop, incl. a new `coreBridge.test`
  driving real `@selfos/core` over `memFileSystem` the way the iOS host will), **27 E2E**. **Lesson: the
  factory's return type is the full `SelfosBridge`, but in Electron the renderer subscriptions
  (`onVaultChanged`/`onChatChunk`) live in the PRELOAD, so the bridge's own subscription methods are
  no-ops in main — they exist for the iOS host. Keep streaming as `emitChatChunk` (host sink) + a
  per-turn-bound sender.** **NEXT: iii-b2** — the iOS in-webview host implementing `BridgeHost` + browser
  verification (in-browser FS, DeviceStore over Preferences, temp Secret/Claude stubs), then delete
  `stubBridge.ts`. **(Concurrent-agent note unchanged: left all of `docs/specs/0{4,5,8,9}` + `11`
  untouched; this slice's doc edits are only 07, 10 §5.2, and this entry.)**
- 2026-06-10 — Fix + decisions (**Capacitor track iii-b start: iOS host**). **Decisions (asked):** the
  iOS host shares logic with Electron via **one platform-agnostic `createCoreBridge(host)` factory**
  (both hosts expose the same `SelfosBridge`; ~40 data ops live once), and we **browser-verify the host
  first** (wire `@selfos/core` to an in-browser filesystem so the real app works in the web preview
  before the blind Swift plugin). Sub-slices: **iii-b1** factory + Electron migration → **iii-b2** iOS
  in-webview host + browser verify → **iii-b3** Swift `VaultFs` plugin (Xcode). **Foundational blocker
  found + fixed first:** the iOS host runs `@selfos/core` in the WKWebView, so core must typecheck under
  the renderer's **DOM lib**, but TS 5.7's `Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>` is incompatible with WebCrypto's
  `BufferSource` (wants `ArrayBuffer`, not `SharedArrayBuffer`) — `importKey`/`encrypt`/`decrypt` in
  `cryptoService` wouldn't compile under DOM lib. Added a `bufferSource()` copy at the `subtle.*`
  boundary; **the whole core surface (crypto/people/usage/conversations/vault/host) now typechecks under
  both `tsconfig.web` (DOM) and `tsconfig.node`.** Byte-identical (cryptoCompat fixtures + encrypted-vault
  E2E pass). **Lesson: any code destined for the WebView must be typechecked under the DOM lib early —
  the Node lib is lenient about `BufferSource`/`Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>` where the DOM lib is strict;
  probe with a throwaway import before building on top.** **NEXT: iii-b1 the `createCoreBridge` factory.**
  **Note: a concurrent agent renumbered its stray spec `10-relationship-tracking` → `11` (resolving the
  number collision with this 10-multi-device-vault) and is editing `04`/`05` — left untouched per the
  user; my commits exclude all of `docs/specs/0{4,5,8,9}` + `11`.**
- 2026-06-10 — Build (**Slice 2b — [10-multi-device-vault](docs/specs/10-multi-device-vault.md) Slice 2
  complete; the whole spec is now built**). The **member redeem flow**: `invites:redeem` (needs **no
  device key** — unwraps the master key from the matching invite via core `redeemInvite`, stores it
  device-local, **persists** the resolved person as `DeviceState.pendingJoinPersonId`) +
  `invites:completeJoin` (sets that member's **own PIN** + signs them in; only the redeemed person —
  never the owner — can be completed, so the renderer can't target another account). `UnlockScreen` now
  has two modes: recovery-phrase (owner) and **invite** ("Have an invite code?" → enter code → "Set
  your PIN" → Finish). **Security fix the reviewer caught:** redeem stores the key + consumes the invite
  (single-use), so a crash before the PIN was set would have dropped to an **open person picker** where
  anyone could sign in as the PIN-less member with the key already on disk. Fixed by **persisting the
  pending join device-local** and having `HouseholdGate` **resume the "Set your PIN" step** on next boot.
  Gates green: typecheck/lint/format, **223 unit** (76 core + 147 desktop), **27 E2E** (owner→member
  round trip joins **member-only** + account gains a PIN + invite consumed; an interrupted-redeem reboot;
  a 390px overflow guard on the invite surfaces). **Lesson: a two-step that persists secret material
  (key on disk) in step 1 must make step 2 resumable on crash — otherwise the interrupted state is an
  open door. Persist the pending state and re-route to it on boot.** Multi-device household is DONE:
  one owner/super-admin per directory, no re-keying, recovery-phrase device join, super-admin in the
  vault, owner PIN, and secure member invites.
- 2026-06-10 — Build (**Slice 2a of [10-multi-device-vault](docs/specs/10-multi-device-vault.md)** — the
  owner side of **member invite codes**). **Decisions (asked):** code = **word phrase** (6 words from a
  curated 128-word `inviteWords` list, ~2⁴²); **7-day** expiry; the **member sets their own PIN** on
  redeem (owner never knows it); generated from the member's **Access tab**; QR deferred; invites
  cancelable. Core `@selfos/core/people/inviteService`: `generateInviteCode`, `createInvite` (wraps the
  master key under the code's scrypt KEK into a **key-free-readable** `config/invites/<id>.enc` — the
  redeeming device has no key yet, like `recovery.enc`), `listInvitesForPerson` (GCs expired),
  `cancelInvite`, `redeemInvite` (single-use: deletes on redeem). IPC `invites:create/list/cancel` are
  **owner-only (`people.manage`) AND member-scoped, enforced in main** — `create` rejects a missing/owner
  target and supersedes any prior pending invite (the reviewer flagged closing the UI↔main trust gap).
  Owner UI: `DeviceInviteControl` on the Access tab (generate → code shown **once** + copy + warning;
  pending list + cancel/regenerate). Reviewer: crypto sound (2⁴² + scrypt + 7-day + single-use beats a
  brute-force racing a pending invite; master key never plaintext on disk/IPC). Gates green: typecheck/
  lint/format, **220 unit** (76 core + 144 desktop), visual QA desktop + 390px. **NEXT: Slice 2b** — the
  member **redeem** flow (UnlockScreen "Have an invite code?" → enter code → set own PIN → join) + the
  owner-generate→member-redeem E2E round-trip. **Lesson: enforce member-scoping in MAIN, not just by
  rendering the control for non-owners — the renderer isn't the trust boundary.**
- 2026-06-10 — Build (**Slice 1 of [10-multi-device-vault](docs/specs/10-multi-device-vault.md) complete**
  — sub-slices 1b + 1c shipped on top of 1a). **1b: super-admin secret → the vault.** New
  `@selfos/core/people/superAdmin` writes a salted scrypt hash, encrypted under the master key, to
  `config/superadmin.enc` (the same at-rest pipeline as the rest of the vault); the app module is now a
  thin host wrapper owning a **one-time idempotent device-local→vault migration** (legacy
  `superAdminPassphraseHash` in deviceStore is read once to seed the vault, then unused). `verify`
  degrades to `false` (never throws) on a corrupt file; `has` is **presence-based** so the migration
  can't clobber a corrupt copy. So the super-admin is now **one-per-directory** and works on any device
  holding the key. **1c: owner PIN required at Setup.** A "Your PIN" + "Confirm PIN" field (min
  `MIN_OWNER_PIN_LENGTH`=4) threads through `householdSetup` into the owner account, so a leaked
  recovery phrase alone can't sign in as the owner on a joined device. Reviewer verdicts: 1b **ship**
  (hash never plaintext on disk/logs; migration idempotent + can't fail-open), 1c **ship** (validation
  parity front-to-back; the Confirm-PIN was added per the reviewer's typo-lockout flag). Also **fixed a
  pre-existing flaky E2E**: the concealed super-admin long-press now dispatches `pointerdown`/`up`
  directly on the version element (deterministic; 8/8 under `--repeat-each`) instead of
  `click({delay})`. Gates green: typecheck/lint/format, **210 unit** (69 core + 141 desktop), **25 E2E**.
  **NOTE (flag): three spec files appeared untracked in the tree mid-session — `08-questionnaires.md`,
  `09-session-analysis.md`, and `10-relationship-tracking.md` (a number-10 collision with this spec) —
  created by something outside this work; left untracked, not committed. Needs the user to decide.**
- 2026-06-10 — Spec approved + **Slice 1a built**: **[10-multi-device-vault](docs/specs/10-multi-device-vault.md)**
  (multi-device household — vault identity, device join & recovery). User flagged: only **one owner +
  one super-admin per directory** — a second person opening the same shared (iCloud) folder must NOT
  become owner/super-admin; a **member** should install on their own device and do member things.
  Investigation found it's worse than that: the boot gate decided "first-run setup" from whether **this
  device** held the master key, so a 2nd device re-ran Setup → `createMasterKey` **overwrote
  `config/recovery.enc`** (orphaning all ciphertext) **+ minted a second owner** — a data-loss bug.
  **Decisions (asked):** super-admin hash moves **into the vault**; **phased** delivery — Slice 1
  (safety fix: detection + guards + super-admin→vault + recovery-phrase unlock) then Slice 2 (one-time
  member **invite/pairing codes** — chosen over PIN-wrapping the master key, which is offline-
  brute-forceable from the synced file); owner **PIN required** at Setup; recovery-phrase unlock allows
  **any persona** (it's the owner's secret; members onboard via Slice 2). Slice 1 ships in 3 sub-slices:
  **1a (done)** = key-free `vaultInitialized` (recovery.enc presence) + a hard `createMasterKey` guard
  that **never overwrites** an existing recovery.enc + a resume-aware `setupHousehold` (finishes an
  interrupted setup without re-keying, refuses a second owner) + the **three-way `HouseholdGate`**
  (Setup / `UnlockScreen` / Shell-or-picker) + `household:unlockWithRecoveryPhrase` IPC + the
  recovery-phrase `UnlockScreen`; **1b** = super-admin → `config/superadmin.enc` (+ migration); **1c** =
  owner PIN at Setup. Reviewer verdict: the re-key guard is airtight (recovery.enc byte-identical after
  a blocked 2nd setup; phrase never logged; renderer never sees the key). Gates green: typecheck/lint/
  format, **203 unit** (64 core + 139 desktop), **25 E2E** (incl. 2nd-device-unlocks-no-second-owner +
  interrupted-setup-resume). **Lesson: "is the vault set up?" is a property of the VAULT (a key-free
  file marker), not of the device's keychain — conflating them re-keys shared vaults.**
- 2026-06-10 — Fix (responsive Settings + Roles — user flagged from the iOS simulator): two screens
  failed the responsive DoD at phone width. **Settings** crammed the 176px section rail beside the
  content, crushing field descriptions to one-word-per-line; now below `--bp-md` the layout is one
  column, the section nav is a **horizontal scrollable pill row** (44px tap targets) above the content,
  and each `SettingField` **stacks** the label/description above a full-width control. Desktop keeps the
  sticky side rail + two-column rows (unchanged). **Roles** was a 4-column `role × capability` `<table>`
  that needed horizontal scroll and clipped the Guest column + left labels; redesigned into **per-role
  cards** (Owner/Member/Guest) — a 3-up `auto-fit minmax(240px,1fr)` grid on desktop that **stacks** on
  phones, so there's never a horizontal scroll. Owner card is locked all-on with a "Full access" marker.
  Per-toggle `aria-label`s (`"{role}: {capability}"`) are preserved; the visible capability label is
  `aria-hidden` to avoid a double SR announcement. **Decisions (asked):** Settings nav = pill row; Roles
  = card-per-role. Tests: Roles unit asserts the Full-access marker; the **390px E2E guard now walks
  Settings** (+ a per-section-pill sub-walk) and asserts the **Roles cards stack** (shared left edge).
  doc-auditor: specs say "matrix" conceptually (not `<table>`) so **no spec edits** needed. Gates green:
  typecheck/lint/format, 193 unit, 23 E2E. **Lesson (again): desktop-fine ≠ phone-fine — these only
  surfaced on the simulator; screenshot every touched surface at 390px.**
- 2026-06-10 — Fix (iOS deployment target → **18.0**) + note: the **generated `ios/` Xcode project is now
  tracked** in the repo (`apps/desktop/ios/`). `cap add ios` (run while iterating on the simulator) scaffolds
  the project at Capacitor's default **iOS 14.0**; corrected the `Podfile` (`platform :ios, '18.0'`) and all
  four `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` build settings in `App.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` to **18.0** to match the
  approved [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) decision (§ resolved questions). The project
  is the **code-ready iOS shell** the spec calls for, so it belongs in source: tracked = the project, Swift
  (`AppDelegate`), `Info.plist`, storyboards, asset metadata, `Podfile`/`Podfile.lock`; **gitignored** =
  `Pods/`, `App/public/` (the synced web build), `DerivedData/` (build artifacts — regenerated by
  `cap sync` / Xcode). Bundle id `com.highfivery.selfos`, display name SelfOS (both correct). **Note: the
  safe-area commit (890bc63) swept the freshly-generated `ios/` in via `git add` without naming it — content
  is right (source tracked, artifacts ignored), only the message was silent; recording it here.**
- 2026-06-10 — Fix (iOS safe-area — user flagged from the simulator): on iPhone the shell drew under the
  status bar / notch, tucking the TopBar hamburger up where it was hard to tap (and content ran under the
  home indicator). Applied **`env(safe-area-inset-*)`** (enabled by the `viewport-fit=cover` from iii-a):
  TopBar `padding-top`/`-right`, the off-canvas sidebar drawer `padding-top`/`-bottom`, and `contentInner`
  `padding-bottom` — all `calc(base + env(..., 0px))`, so **0 on desktop/Electron** (no notch → unchanged;
  23 E2E + the 390px responsive guard green) and correct on iOS. Implements 07-mobile-platform §5.4
  (safe-area insets). **Lesson: the desktop browser can't show this (env insets are 0 without a real
  notch) — iOS chrome issues like this surface only on the device/simulator.**
- 2026-06-10 — Build (Capacitor track **slice (iii-a): iOS scaffold + web build** —
  [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.3/§5.4): first iOS step — the React renderer
  now has a **standalone web build** (`vite.web.config.ts` → `dist-web/`, `pnpm build:web`) separate from
  the electron-vite build, entered via `index.html`→`main.web.tsx`. Added **Capacitor** (`@capacitor/
core`+`ios`+`cli`) + `capacitor.config.ts` (`com.highfivery.selfos`, webDir `dist-web`). A **temporary
  stub `window.selfos`** (`host/stubBridge.ts`, full `SelfosBridge`, no-op/empty data) lets the UI render
  in the iOS WKWebView so we can validate the Capacitor→Xcode→device toolchain BEFORE the real native
  hosts (iCloud FS / Keychain / Claude) land in iii-b/c/d — it's clearly throwaway and gets deleted then.
  Verified here: `build:web` produces a valid SPA, the full shell renders at 375px (served + screenshotted),
  Electron is untouched (23 E2E green), 193 unit green, typecheck/lint/format clean. **Decisions (asked):**
  Mac yes; **free personal signing first → Developer Program + TestFlight later** (a trivial Xcode signing-
  team switch, no code changes); bundle id `com.highfivery.selfos`; **min iOS 18**. **NOTE: `pnpm build:web`
  must run before `cap add ios` / `cap sync`.** Next: **iii-b** the Swift VaultFs plugin (iCloud-Drive
  picker + bookmarks + coordinated FS) + the real in-webview host wiring `@selfos/core`.
- 2026-06-10 — Build (cleanup: **`masterKey` → `@selfos/core/crypto`**, closing the last `Buffer` bridge):
  moved `masterKey.ts` (master-key generate/store/recover flow) out of `apps/desktop/src/main/crypto/`
  into core so the future iOS host gets the flow too. It was already node/electron-free; the only thing
  pinning it to the app was its `Buffer` return. Now it returns/uses **`Uint8Array`** (via the core
  `toBase64`/`fromBase64` helpers), so the app threads `Uint8Array` for the master key **end-to-end** —
  no Buffer bridge left. `ipc.vaultAndKey()`/`activePersonCan` key types → `Uint8Array`; household + e2e
  import masterKey from `@selfos/core/crypto`. **recovery.enc + the stored master key are byte-identical**
  (the reviewer fuzz-verified `toBase64`/`fromBase64` == `Buffer` base64 across all 0–255 bytes), so
  existing vaults still restore. The app's `main/crypto/` dir is gone. Gates green: typecheck/lint/format,
  **193 unit** (61 core + 132 desktop), 23 E2E (one clean run; a transient people-CRUD e2e timeout under a
  loaded run passed on isolation + re-run — pre-existing Playwright/Electron timing flakiness, not a
  regression, per reviewer). **The `@selfos/core` extraction is now fully complete incl. masterKey.**
- 2026-06-10 — Fix (red CI build — user flagged): `apps/desktop/src/main/host/nodeSecretStore.test.ts`
  value-imported `passthroughEncryptor` from `secrets/encryptor.ts`, which **top-level-imports
  `electron`** (`safeStorage`). CI runs the Vitest unit tests **without the Electron binary**, so loading
  `electron` threw `Electron failed to install correctly`. Fixed by injecting an **inline fake `Encryptor`**
  in the test (the established pattern — the old secret-store test + the e2e both do this) and importing
  `Encryptor` as a **type-only** import (erased at build → no `electron` load). **Lesson: unit tests must
  not transitively import `electron`; my local `pnpm test` masked it because electron IS installed locally
  but CI's isn't. When a unit test needs a host dependency that pulls electron (`encryptor`, ipc, window,
  menu, …), inject a fake and `import type` only — never value-import the electron-pulling module.** (This
  test was introduced in ii-c; it had been failing CI since then.)
- 2026-06-10 — Build (Capacitor track **relocation slice 3 (final): move usage/budgets/chat into core**
  — [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.2): relocated `pricing`/`usageStore`/
  `budgetService` → **`@selfos/core/usage`** and `promptBuilder`/`chatService` → **`@selfos/core/conversations`**
  (+ tests) — verbatim, **no behavior change**. Moved files take `key: Uint8Array`; chatService's
  `node:crypto randomUUID` → core `uuid()`. The 4 IPC view types (`UsageSummary`/`BudgetState`/
  `BudgetStateKind`/`ChatTurnResult`) moved into core **`schemas.ts`** (same crypto-free rule as
  `AccessView`) so `channels.ts` imports them from the schemas shim and the renderer/web tsconfig never
  pulls `core/crypto`. New export `./usage`. Moved tests use the `memFileSystem` fake. **This completes
  the `@selfos/core` extraction** — ALL platform-agnostic business logic (crypto, vault I/O, people/access,
  conversations, usage/budgets, prompt builder, pricing) now lives in core behind the host interfaces; the
  app's `main/` is just host impls (`nodeFileSystem`/`nodeSecretStore`/`anthropicClient`/`encryptor`), the
  `claudeService` proxy, **`masterKey`** (the app's `Buffer` bridge), device-local state (`deviceStore`/
  `session`/`superAdmin`/`settings`), `vault` bootstrap/watcher/conflicts, `ipc`, and the renderer. Fixed a
  latent Playwright strict-mode flake in the chat e2e (`.first()` — the streaming bubble + persisted message
  both match during the stream→save handoff). Gates green: typecheck/lint/format, **193 unit** (58 core +
  135 desktop), 23 E2E. **NEXT: the iOS-only work — (iii) Capacitor shell + iOS plugins + binding, (iv)
  build/signing — needs a Mac/Xcode + the user's Apple Developer team + bundle id (ASK).**
- 2026-06-10 — Build (Capacitor track **relocation slice 2: move the people/access domain into
  `@selfos/core/people`** — [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.2): relocated
  `peopleService`/`relationshipService`/`accessService`/`buildContext` (+ tests) into core — verbatim,
  **no behavior change**. Moved files take `key: Uint8Array` (app passes `Buffer`, assignable) and use a
  new portable **`uuid()`** (`globalThis.crypto.randomUUID`, core `id.ts`) instead of `node:crypto`. The
  **`AccessView`** view type moved into core **`schemas.ts`** (not accessService) on purpose: `channels.ts`
  keeps importing it from the crypto-free schemas shim, so the renderer/web tsconfig never pulls
  `core/crypto` (importing it via `@selfos/core/people` would drag crypto under the DOM lib and trip a
  TS5.7 `BufferSource` error). The IPC `SelfosBridge` contract is unchanged. Moved tests use the core
  **`memFileSystem`** fake (the host-level `ENOTDIR` case stays covered by `nodeFileSystem.test`). New
  export `./people`. The app's `people/` is now just `household`/`session`/`superAdmin` (device-local
  orchestration; household keeps `randomUUID` as an app-host detail). Gates green: typecheck/lint/format,
  **193 unit** (41 core + 152 desktop), 23 E2E. Next relocation: **usage/budgets/chat** (usageStore/
  budgetService/pricing/promptBuilder/chatService + the UsageSummary/BudgetState/ChatTurnResult view
  types), then decide whether masterKey moves (full `Uint8Array`) or stays the app Buffer bridge.
- 2026-06-10 — Build (Capacitor track **relocation slice 1: move the vault-data I/O into `@selfos/core`**
  — [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.2): began physically moving the
  now-platform-agnostic service files (abstracted behind host interfaces in ii-b/ii-c) into core. This
  slice relocates **`encryptedStore` → `@selfos/core/vault`** and **`conversationService` →
  `@selfos/core/conversations`** (verbatim moves; **no behavior change**). Core can't use `Buffer`, so the
  moved files type keys as **`Uint8Array`**; the app still threads `Buffer` (a `Uint8Array` subclass —
  assignable), so `masterKey` stays the app's `Buffer` bridge and the 5 staying app services
  (people/relationship/access/usage/budget) pass `Buffer` into core's `Uint8Array` params unchanged. Added
  a core **`memFileSystem`** in-memory test fake (the moved conversation test + a new `encryptedStore`
  round-trip test run with no node/disk) and new package exports `./vault` + `./conversations`. On-disk
  format/paths byte-identical (23 E2E seed+read through the relocated core). Gates green: typecheck/lint/
  format, **193 unit** (28 core + 165 desktop), 23 E2E. Next relocation slices: the **people/access**
  domain (peopleService/relationshipService/accessService/buildContext + the `AccessView` view type), then
  **usage/budgets/chat** (usageStore/budgetService/chatService/pricing/promptBuilder + UsageSummary/
  BudgetState/ChatTurnResult); each moved service switches `Buffer`→`Uint8Array` + portable `uuid()`.
- 2026-06-10 — Build (Capacitor track **slice (ii-c): SecretStore + ClaudeClient host interfaces** —
  [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.1/§5.3): added the last two platform host
  interfaces to **`@selfos/core/host`** — **`SecretStore`** (`get`/`set`/`has`/`clear`) and
  **`ClaudeClient`** (moved verbatim out of the app's `claudeService`) — and rewired the remaining
  node/electron-coupled business logic onto them (structural DI, **no behavior change**). The Electron
  **`createNodeSecretStore(userDataDir, encryptor)`** (app `main/host/`) is the old `secrets/secretStore`
  logic (secrets.json + `safeStorage` encryptor) moved verbatim; the `Encryptor` interface now lives in
  `secrets/encryptor.ts`. **`masterKey`** now takes `(secrets: SecretStore[, fs: FileSystem])` and reads/
  writes `config/recovery.enc` via `fs` → it is **fully node/electron-free** (only `@selfos/core` + zod).
  `ipc.ts` got a `secretStore()` helper; household builds `secrets`+`fs` internally. **recovery.enc and
  secrets.json on-disk formats are byte-identical** (existing vaults still restore + decrypt — verified
  by the reviewer + 23 E2E that seed/read through the new path). masterKey.test now uses an in-memory
  `SecretStore` fake. Gates green: typecheck/lint/format, **189 unit** (22 core + 167 desktop), 23 E2E.
  Next: a **relocation slice** — physically move the now-platform-agnostic service files (people / usage /
  conversation / buildContext / encryptedStore / masterKey) into `@selfos/core` (+ `Buffer`→`Uint8Array`,
  portable uuid, mem-fake tests). That completes the desktop-verifiable extraction; then (iii) the
  Capacitor iOS shell + (iv) build/signing need a Mac/Xcode.
- 2026-06-10 — Build (Capacitor track **slice (ii-b): FileSystem host + the encrypted vault-data layer**
  — [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.1/§5.3): introduced the **`FileSystem`
  host interface** (`@selfos/core/host`: `read`/`writeAtomic`/`list`/`remove`, **vault-relative** POSIX
  paths) and refactored the encrypted data layer to depend on it instead of `node:fs`/`node:path` — a
  **pure I/O abstraction, no behavior change**. `encryptedStore` + the 6 data services (people /
  relationship / access / usage / budget / conversation) + buildContext/promptBuilder/chatService now
  thread `fs: FileSystem`; the Electron impl **`createNodeFileSystem(vaultDir)`** (app
  `main/host/`) is node `fs` rooted at the vault + atomic temp-file→rename + `notifyWrite` echo-
  suppression. `ipc.ts` `vaultAndKey()` → `{ fs, key }`. Services **stay in the app** for now (still use
  `key: Buffer` + `randomUUID`); they **relocate into core** in a later slice. On-disk format/paths are
  byte-identical (proven: 23 E2E seed+read real encrypted vaults; encrypted-at-rest unit assertions read
  the real `.enc`). Gates green: typecheck/lint/format, **189 unit** (22 core + 167 desktop), 23 E2E.
  **Lesson (code-reviewer caught a real regression): the old `listPeople` filtered `isDirectory()`; the
  fs version `getPerson`s every entry, so a stray `people/.DS_Store` (common in iCloud/Dropbox-synced
  vaults) made `read('people/.DS_Store/profile.enc')` throw `ENOTDIR` and cascade into Usage + chat
  context. Fixed in the host — `read`/`list` treat `ENOTDIR` like `ENOENT` (absent → null/[]) — + a
  `nodeFileSystem` contract test and a stray-file `listPeople` regression test.**
- 2026-06-10 — Build (Capacitor track **slice (ii-a): scaffold `@selfos/core` + extract crypto + shared
  schemas** — [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.2): created the platform-agnostic
  **`@selfos/core`** workspace package (source-only; `exports` map → `.ts`; bundled into Electron `main`
  by excluding it from electron-vite's `externalizeDepsPlugin`). Moved the shared Zod schemas/types
  (`schemas`, `capabilities`, `usageTypes`, `appearance`) and the at-rest crypto (`cryptoService`, `pin`)
  into core; `apps/desktop/src/shared/*` are now **thin re-export shims** so the renderer + IPC
  `channels.ts` are **untouched**. Completed the deferred **`Buffer`→`Uint8Array` + portable-base64**
  (`btoa`/`atob` in `encoding.ts`) migration so core is `node:*`/`Buffer`-free; the app keeps threading
  `Buffer` and **bridges at `masterKey.ts`**. Portability is enforced by an **ESLint override** on
  `packages/core` (no `Buffer`, no `node:*`/`electron`). Byte-compat fixtures moved into core and still
  pass (vaults stay readable). Decisions (asked): **incremental sub-slices**, **thread the host objects**
  (next slices), **schemas into core + shim**. Gates green: typecheck/lint/format, **183 unit** (22 core
  - 161 desktop), **23 E2E** (the built app bundles core + seeds/reads encrypted vaults). Next: **(ii-b)**
    FileSystem host + the file-using services.
- 2026-06-10 — Build (Capacitor track **slice (i): crypto unification** —
  [07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md) §5.1): the at-rest crypto is rewritten **off
  `node:crypto` onto WebCrypto (`globalThis.crypto.subtle`, AES-256-GCM) + `scrypt-js`** so one
  implementation runs on both Electron (Node ≥20) and the future iOS WKWebView. `cryptoService`,
  `masterKey`, and `pin` no longer touch `node:crypto`; the scrypt KDF is one shared `deriveScrypt`
  (params `N=16384,r=8,p=1`), PIN compare is a hand-rolled constant-time check. **The on-disk envelope
  `{v:1,alg,iv,tag,data}` and all params are unchanged** — WebCrypto's appended 16-byte GCM tag is split
  back out — so **existing vaults stay byte-for-byte readable**. WebCrypto/scrypt are async, so `await`
  rippled through `encryptedStore`/`accessService`/`superAdmin`/`masterKey` + tests + the e2e seeds.
  Proof: a new **`cryptoCompat.test`** asserts the new code decrypts/derives/verifies **real fixtures
  captured from the old `node:crypto` code** (not a self round-trip); 183 unit + 23 E2E green (the e2e
  seeds _and_ boots an encrypted vault). Decision: **`Buffer` stays** this slice; the `Buffer→Uint8Array`
  - portable-base64 + `randomUUID` migration is slice (ii) ("extract `@selfos/core`, no `node:*`").
- 2026-06-10 — Spec approved: **[07-mobile-platform](docs/specs/07-mobile-platform.md)** (Capacitor +
  iCloud-Drive vault). SelfOS comes to iPhone as one codebase: the same responsive renderer in a
  WKWebView, sharing the same iCloud-Drive vault as desktop, via a **platform-adapter** (FileSystem /
  SecretStore / ClaudeClient host interfaces) so the Electron-main business logic runs on both hosts.
  Resolved: sequencing = **(i) crypto unification → (ii) extract `@selfos/core` + re-wire Electron →
  (iii) Capacitor shell + iOS plugins → (iv) user builds/signs**; crypto **unified on WebCrypto +
  scrypt-js** (one impl, existing vaults stay readable); iOS Claude = **browser-mode SDK with a
  native-HTTP fallback**; **iOS-only**, **code-ready** build. Slices (i)+(ii) are desktop-verifiable
  here; (iii)+(iv) need a Mac/Xcode. GitHub: repo live at `Highfivery/SelfOS`, CI (lint/typecheck/unit)
  green; E2E stays local (needs a display).
- 2026-06-10 — Fix (TopBar alignment + usage-ring visibility — user flagged): the appearance toggle,
  usage ring, and account control now share a fixed **32px height** and align to the same top edge
  (the ring's wrapper was `display:block`, a line-box gap that floated it ~2px high; now `inline-flex`
  like its siblings). The usage ring's track moved from the near-invisible `--color-surface-alt` to
  `--color-border-strong` so the ring actually reads. Added an **E2E geometry guard** asserting the
  three TopBar controls share a top edge + height (≤1px). **Lesson (again): measure geometry in
  testing — I missed a 2px vertical misalignment + an invisible ring by not screenshotting/measuring
  the TopBar.**
- 2026-06-10 — UI polish + feedback (user flagged three shipped-but-unpolished things): (1) **buttons
  in rows of labelled fields now bottom-align** with the inputs (`Inline align="end"` in the budget
  editors) instead of floating mid-height; (2) the **appearance toggle was redesigned** for the
  TopBar — a compact single theme-icon button opening a System/Light/Dark popover (matching the
  usage-ring/account menus, conserving horizontal space), replacing the relocated 3-segment control;
  (3) the **sidebar brand was redesigned** — the sprout sits in a soft accent app-icon tile + a tighter
  wordmark, so it reads as intentional, not an afterthought. New standing rules: **visual QA is part of
  testing** (DoD §7 + §12) and **"improve" means redesign, not relocate** (§12). **Lesson: my earlier
  "move the toggle" / "add an icon" did the minimum; screenshot-and-scrutinize alignment + polish every
  time, and treat "improve X" as a redesign brief.**

- 2026-06-10 — Build (Slice D — responsive pass): SelfOS is now **one responsive codebase**
  (~360px→desktop). Breakpoint tokens (480/768/1024/1280) in `tokens.css`; below 768px the sidebar
  becomes an **off-canvas drawer** (overlay + scrim) from a TopBar hamburger (closes on nav-select /
  Esc / scrim / resize); two-pane screens (**Sessions**, **People**) collapse to a **master–detail**
  with a back affordance; the Sessions **crisis footer** was pulled out of the thread pane so it stays
  present in both list and detail views; `SegmentedControl` scrolls-x when it can't fit (the 5 person
  tabs on a phone); content padding tightens; tap targets ≥44px; the account name hides <480px. A
  **390px mobile-width E2E guard** walks every screen + opens the People editor, asserting no
  horizontal overflow on the content scroll container (not just `main` — caught a clipped People pane
  a `main`-only check missed). **Lesson: an E2E overflow guard that only checks `main` misses inner
  scroll containers; verify with a real screenshot at mobile width.**
- 2026-06-10 — Build (admin-only marker): a reusable **`AdminOnlyBadge`** design-system primitive (a
  "🔒 Admin only" pill, icon + text, never colour-alone) now marks every admin-gated surface so admins
  know normal users don't see it (§12) — applied to the Usage cost figure, the person picker, the
  by-person card, and the overall-cap editor; the person **Budget** tab; and the **Roles** screen.
  Added to `/gallery`. Tests: a component test + Usage/Roles unit assertions (present for admins,
  absent for users) + E2E (Budget-tab badge, none on a member's Usage, markers appear on super-admin
  unlock). This is the standing convention for all current and future admin-gated UI.
- 2026-06-10 — Build (app-shell chrome): sprout brand lockup; appearance toggle + usage ring + a new
  account menu (Switch person / Lock / super-admin Lock-inspect) in the slot-based **TopBar**; sidebar
  footer reduced to Settings + a **collapse toggle** (desktop icon rail, persisted device-local);
  **logout = lock to a full-screen person picker** (a UI reveal-gate). Added Textarea to `/gallery`.
  Updated [02-app-shell](docs/specs/02-app-shell.md) §3.4–3.6, §4, §6, §11.
- 2026-06-10 — Correction landed: **removed the `questionnaires.answer` / `questionnaires.assign`
  capabilities** (unbuilt-feature scaffolding flagged in the prior entry). Stripped from
  `shared/capabilities.ts` (CAPABILITIES, labels, default Member/Guest roles) and synced
  [04-people-roles](docs/specs/04-people-roles.md). **Member** now defaults to own relationships + own
  sessions; **Guest** now has **no capabilities** (a login slot until a Guest purpose is specced).
  Questionnaires stays on the roadmap; its capabilities return when specced.
- 2026-06-10 — **Session decisions confirmed (ask-first) for the app-shell modernization + responsive
  pass:** brand mark = a **Sprout** (dusty-blue, with a "SelfOS" wordmark → sidebar lockup + app icon);
  **Logout = lock to a full-screen person picker** (PIN-less people resume immediately; a UI
  reveal-gate like the super-admin lock); **desktop sidebar collapse = icon rail** (drawer below
  768px); **admin-only marker = a "lock + 'Admin only'" pill** primitive (section-level by default);
  **breakpoint tokens = 480 / 768 / 1024 / 1280** (mobile-width E2E guard at 390px). TopBar gains the
  appearance toggle + logout (out of the sidebar footer) and the mobile hamburger.
- 2026-06-10 — Captured UI/UX conventions (new §12) + DoD items from user feedback: the app must be
  **fully responsive** (one codebase, ~360px→desktop); **admin-only UI must be visibly marked**;
  **global controls (usage ring, appearance toggle, logout) live in the TopBar**; **`/gallery` must
  stay current** with every primitive; and **no scaffolding for unbuilt features**. Also flagged: the
  `questionnaires.*` capabilities were an unspecced assumption and must be **removed** until the
  feature is specced. These feed the next session (Slice D + app-shell modernization + Capacitor track).
- 2026-06-09 — Initial CLAUDE.md established. Stack, architecture principles, Definition of Done,
  living-docs loops, and git standards set per the approved foundation plan.
- 2026-06-09 — Build slice 1 landed: electron-vite app scaffold (secure window, design tokens, themed
  shell, typed IPC). Tests are now per-package (jsdom for the renderer); lint-staged runs lint+format
  only (tests run on pre-push/CI); Playwright-Electron E2E harness added.
- 2026-06-09 — Build slice 2: design-system primitives (Stack, Inline, Heading, Text, Button,
  IconButton, Card, Field, TextInput, Select, Switch, Slider, SegmentedControl) on tokens + CSS
  Modules, plus a dev-only `/gallery` route. AppearanceToggle refactored onto SegmentedControl.
- 2026-06-09 — Build slice 3: vault service (initialize/status + atomic JSON writes), device-local
  state store, real boot-state computation + IPC, and the boot gate (Splash / Onboarding /
  VaultError / Ready). Deferred to a follow-up: file-watching, sync-conflict detection, migrations,
  window-state persistence, native menu.
- 2026-06-09 — Build slice 3b (vault hardening): schema-migration runner + registries (wired into
  reads), window-state persistence (clamp to a visible display), sync-conflict detection (detector +
  IPC + warning Banner), and file-watching (chokidar v3, echo-suppression, `vault:changed`). Note:
  the watcher currently starts only when the app boots already-ready; starting it after onboarding
  and the native menu remain follow-ups.
- 2026-06-09 — Polish: centralized the vault-watcher lifecycle so it (re)starts right after
  onboarding (not only on a ready boot), and added a native application menu (standard roles + Open
  Vault Folder). Resolves the slice-3b follow-ups.
- 2026-06-09 — Dev ergonomics: added root `dev`/`build` scripts (so `pnpm dev` runs the desktop app)
  and set an explicit Electron app name (`app.setName('SelfOS')`) so dev `userData` is `SelfOS`,
  avoiding a single-instance-lock collision with other scaffolded `@selfos/desktop` apps.
- 2026-06-09 — Build slice 4 (v1 centerpiece): the schema-driven settings system. Registry +
  control registry + typed `useSetting` (declaration-merged `SettingsTypeMap`), vault-scoped
  persistence + IPC, and an auto-generated Settings UI (sections, search, per-setting reset). Working
  Appearance settings (theme/density/text-size/reduce-motion) applied via tokens; Vault + About
  sections. `ThemeProvider` now reads from settings. Added a shared mock-bridge test helper. Deferred:
  accent options, high-contrast, the AI/secret settings + keychain (slice 5), and the broader
  feature-module registry abstraction.
- 2026-06-09 — Build People-2c (switcher + access + capability gating): grant/update/revoke a
  person's login (role + optional PIN) in the person editor; a "Who's here?" switcher (from the shell
  footer) changes the active person with PIN verification; `sessionStore` gains `capabilities` +
  `can()`, and the People nav is gated by `people.manage`. IPC: `access:get` (redacted — no PIN
  hashes), `access:setAccount`, `access:removeAccount`, `session:setActive`. Tests + an E2E (grant,
  switch, nav gated). Known v1 limits: only the nav (not the route) is gated, and a PIN-less owner is
  switchable by anyone on the device — the super-admin passphrase is the real gate. The roles×capability
  matrix editor, the concealed super-admin unlock, and shareable context are People-3.
- 2026-06-10 — Build Metering-2 (usage dashboard + budgets UI for
  [06-ai-usage-and-budgets](docs/specs/06-ai-usage-and-budgets.md)): a **Usage** screen (nav gated by
  `sessions.own`) with scope (Mine / Everyone — app gated by `settings.manage`) + period (week/month)
  toggles, totals (estimated cost, sessions, avg per session/type, input/output/cache tokens, cache
  savings), by-type + by-model breakdowns, and per-person + app budget editors with accessible
  `<progress>` bars. IPC: `usage:summary`, `budget:get`/`setApp`/`setPerson`/`status` (computed in
  main; `UsageSummary`/`BudgetState` moved to shared). Tests + an E2E (seeded usage → dashboard +
  budget save + no-overflow guard). v1 limit: app-scope is UI-gated, not IPC-enforced.
- 2026-06-10 — Fix (Roles matrix display): the role × capability matrix now renders each toggle via
  `roleAllows` instead of the raw stored map, so the **Owner column shows all-on** — including
  capabilities added after the vault was created (e.g. `budgets.manage`). Pairs with the owner
  full-access fix below; a test covers a stale stored owner map rendering all-on.
- 2026-06-10 — Fix (Owner full access — the real bug): `roleAllows` now grants the **Owner every
  capability**, not just those in its stored map. Setup persists the owner role's capability map frozen
  at that moment, so a vault created before a capability existed (e.g. `budgets.manage`, added in
  Metering-3) left the Owner without it — denying budget/usage/cost/config. Now the Owner has full
  access regardless of when the vault was made or what capabilities are added later. Unit tests for the
  stale-map case + an E2E that boots a pre-`budgets.manage` vault and confirms the Owner sees cost + the
  person picker + by-person and can set a budget. **Lesson: my earlier "fix" + E2E only seeded FRESH
  vaults (which pick up current capabilities), so they never exercised a real persisted vault and the
  bug survived three reports — verify against the actual persisted state, not an idealized seed.**
- 2026-06-10 — Fix (super-admin parity): the concealed super-admin's inspect mode now bypasses
  capability gating in the **main** process, not just the renderer. Main tracks super-admin active
  state (set on `superadmin:unlock`, cleared by a new `superadmin:lock`), so `activePersonCan` returns
  true while it's active — a super-admin signed in as a non-admin gets full budget/usage/cost access
  (writes, the Everyone scope, by-person), matching the Owner. Before, main still checked the active
  person's role, so the admin UI showed but the data was silently redacted/blocked. The Usage view
  reloads when admin status flips. Tests + an E2E (a Member unlocks → cost + Everyone + by-person).
- 2026-06-10 — Build Slice C (admin usage by person): `usage:summary` now accepts an arbitrary
  `personId` (admin-only, enforced in main) and the summary gained a **`byPerson`** breakdown. The
  Usage dashboard replaces the Mine/Everyone toggle with a **person picker** (Everyone + each person)
  and adds a **"By person"** card in the Everyone view (names resolved via `peopleList`). Tests + E2E
  (pick a person; by-person card).
- 2026-06-10 — Build Slice B (compact top-bar usage ring): replaced the full-width usage header with a
  small circular **usage ring** (SVG donut that recolors at warn/over) inside a new **slot-based
  `TopBar`** (ready for more items as the app grows). Clicking opens a popover with quick stats —
  period, % of allowance, sessions; **$ for admins only** — and a "View usage details" link to
  `/usage`. Added a `--shadow-overlay` token (first elevation in the otherwise-flat design). Tests +
  E2E (ring → popover → link).
- 2026-06-10 — Build Slice A (per-person budgets on a tabbed, scalable person page): `PersonEditor`
  rebuilt into **tabs** (Profile / Notes / Relationships / Access / Budget) so person-scoped settings
  grow without one long page; shared + private notes are now **textareas** (new `Textarea` primitive);
  **per-person budgets** move to a `budgets.manage`-gated **Budget tab** via `budget:getPerson` +
  `budget:setPerson({personId,budget})` (admin-enforced in main, $10/week default); the Usage view now
  keeps only the **optional overall app cap**. Tests + E2E (budget-tab round-trip).
- 2026-06-10 — Build Metering-3 (admin-only budgets + a usage header + cost hidden from users — user
  correction to [06](docs/specs/06-ai-usage-and-budgets.md)): a `budgets.manage` capability (Owner by
  default) gates budget editing, cost ($) display, and the "Everyone" scope; budget _writes_ and the
  Everyone scope are enforced in main. A **$10/week default budget** applies to anyone unset. **Cost is
  removed from Sessions**; a **global header bar** shows the active person's usage as a percentage of
  their budget (no $). The Usage view is role-aware — users see only their own usage with no dollar
  amounts; admins keep cost, the Everyone scope, and the budget editors. **Lesson: ask, don't assume** —
  these visibility rules were originally guessed.
- 2026-06-10 — Rename the chat surface to **"Sessions"** across the UI (user request): nav, the
  `/sessions` route, the `Sessions` component + `routes/sessions/` folder, and visible copy ("This
  session", "New session", "Session title", "begin a session"). Internal names (the `conversation*`
  services/store, `chat:*` IPC channels, `chatService.runChatTurn`) are unchanged — a "session" is one
  conversation, matching the metering's avg-per-session.
- 2026-06-10 — Build Chat-6c (chat polish): conversation **rename** (inline edit; `conversations:rename`
  IPC), a "Coach is thinking…" indicator while awaiting the first chunk, an **Open Settings** shortcut
  in the not-configured state, and an accessibility pass (`aria-busy` on the thread, composer
  autofocus). Tests + an E2E that renames a conversation. Completes the chat surface.
- 2026-06-10 — Build Chat-6b (the chat UI for [05-conversations](docs/specs/05-conversations.md)):
  a **Chat** screen (nav gated by `sessions.own`) with a conversation list (new/open/delete), a
  streaming message thread, a composer (Enter sends / Shift+Enter newline), a running **cost-in-chat**
  - budget warn/over chip, an always-present crisis **"Get help now"** footer, and a not-configured
    state pointing to Settings → AI. Streaming IPC: `chat:stream` invoke + `chat:chunk` events +
    `onChatChunk` subscribe; `conversations:list/get/delete` (scoped to the active person); the key
    stays in main. Tests + an E2E (send → streamed reply → cost + crisis, no overflow). **SelfOS can
    now hold a conversation.**
- 2026-06-10 — Build Chat-6a (streaming chat backend for
  [05-conversations](docs/specs/05-conversations.md)): `conversationService` (encrypted per-person
  transcript CRUD); `promptBuilder` (PERSONA + SAFETY + `buildContext` → system prompt); a streaming
  `ClaudeClient` (real SDK impl with **adaptive thinking** + `cache_control` on the system prefix for
  prompt caching, plus an offline fake); and `chatService.runChatTurn` — the orchestrator: budget
  check (person + app, owner override) → stream deltas → persist the transcript → record a usage event
  (Metering-1). Upgraded `@anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.68→0.104 for adaptive thinking. Backend only — the IPC
  - chat UI are Chat-6b. Tests cover transcripts, the system prompt, and the full turn (stream/persist/
    usage/budget-block/override/continuity).
- 2026-06-10 — Build Metering-1 (usage/pricing/budget core for
  [06-ai-usage-and-budgets](docs/specs/06-ai-usage-and-budgets.md)): a maintained per-model pricing
  table + `costOf`/`cacheSavingsOf`; an encrypted per-person `usageStore` (record → monthly `.enc`
  shards; query by range/person/type; pure `summarize` → totals, by-type, by-model, avg-per-session,
  cache savings); a `budgetService` (per-person + app budgets, `checkBudget` warn→over with an owner
  override, calendar week/month windows); `UsageEvent`/`Budget` schemas + usage-type labels. Backend
  only — the dashboard + budget UI (Metering-2) and the chat consumer come next. Cost is always an
  estimate; events carry token counts only (no message content).
- 2026-06-09 — Build People-3c (shareable-vs-private context) — **completes the People feature
  ([04-people-roles](docs/specs/04-people-roles.md))**: the person editor splits notes into **Shared**
  (`publicNotes`, may feed others' AI) and **Private** (`privateNotes`, never shared); a main-process
  `buildContext(personId)` assembles a session context block — the person's own full profile + the
  shareable facts about the people they relate to (others' `publicNotes` + relationship `publicNotes`),
  **excluding other people's private notes**. Tests prove the exclusion + that both notes persist
  encrypted. `buildContext` is consumed by the AI chat slice (next).
- 2026-06-09 — Build People-3b (concealed super-admin unlock): a hidden long-press on the version in
  About opens a deliberately generic passphrase prompt; the super-admin passphrase (set at setup) is
  verified in main (scrypt, `superadmin:unlock`) and, on success, enters an in-memory inspect-all mode
  where `sessionStore.can()` bypasses all gating (all nav/screens) with a subtle "Super-admin · Lock"
  badge that only shows when active. Tests + an E2E. Note: this is a UI-reveal gate (the app already
  holds the master key); surfacing private _data_ comes with shareable context (People-3c).
- 2026-06-09 — Build People-3a (roles × capability matrix): a **Roles** screen (nav gated by
  `roles.manage`) where the owner toggles each non-owner role's capabilities; the owner column is
  locked all-on. New `access:saveRole` IPC + bridge + `CAPABILITY_LABELS`. Tests + an E2E (owner
  toggles a member capability). People-3b (concealed super-admin unlock) and 3c (shareable context)
  are next.
- 2026-06-09 — Fix: the `Switch` thumb was pushed flush against the right edge when on, because the
  fixed-size control had no `flex-shrink: 0` and got compressed inside content-tight flex rows (e.g.
  the Subject toggle in the person editor). Added `flex: none` to `.switch`; added an E2E geometry
  guard (computed `flex-shrink === '0'` + thumb gaps ≥ 2px) verified to fail without the fix; added a
  DoD rule for control-geometry guards.
- 2026-06-09 — Build People-2b (people + relationship management UI): a **People** screen (list of
  subjects/contacts) with add/edit/delete and a relationship editor (typed links between people),
  backed by people/relationship CRUD IPC (`upsert` owns id + timestamps in main) + a `peopleStore`,
  plus a nav "People" entry. Tests + an E2E that adds a person and links a relationship. The
  "Who's here?" switcher, granting others access (roles/PINs), and capability-gating the nav are
  People-2c.
- 2026-06-09 — Build People-2a (onboarding setup + active person): first run now creates the owner
  (Person #1), sets the super-admin passphrase (device-local scrypt hash), and shows the recovery
  phrase once via `household:setup`; a `HouseholdGate` between boot-ready and the app routes to a
  `Setup` wizard until a master key + owner exist; session/household IPC + bridge
  (`householdStatus`/`householdSetup`/`getActivePerson`) + a "Signed in as …" indicator in the shell.
  E2E seeds an encrypted household so existing tests still boot, plus a new setup-flow E2E. UI to
  add/manage people + the "Who's here?" switcher is People-2b.
- 2026-06-09 — Build People-1 (crypto + data foundation for
  [04-people-roles](docs/specs/04-people-roles.md)): AES-256-GCM at-rest encryption (`cryptoService`)
  with a device-keychain **master key** (`masterKey`) + recovery-phrase wrap/unwrap; encrypted vault
  I/O; Person/Relationship/Role/Account/AccessConfig schemas + a capability registry + default roles
  (Owner/Member/Guest); people/relationship/access services (encrypted, Zod-validated) + scrypt PIN
  hashing. Backend only — IPC/bridge + UI land in People-2. New tests cover crypto round-trip/tamper,
  recovery restore, encrypted-at-rest, and pins.
- 2026-06-09 — Build slice 5 (AI plumbing): encrypted API-key storage via Electron `safeStorage`
  (device-local `secrets.json`, injectable encryptor + test passthrough; the key is write-only to the
  renderer — no `getSecret`), a Claude proxy with an injectable client (`@anthropic-ai/sdk` + an
  offline fake) and a "Test connection", and the AI settings section (enable + model select [default
  `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-8` option] + secret key control), gated by `visibleWhen`. The
  chat surface is a later slice. E2E uses `SELFOS_FAKE_SECRETS`/`SELFOS_FAKE_CLAUDE` for determinism.
- 2026-06-09 — Fix + test hardening: the Vault/About settings sections overflowed and overlapped
  because long custom content (the vault path, the disclaimer) sat in the fixed control column —
  custom rows now render full-width and wrap. Version showed Electron's version; now injected at build
  time via electron-vite `define` (`__APP_VERSION__`). E2E now walks **every** settings section with a
  no-horizontal-overflow visual guard, and `SettingField` has component tests. (Lesson: E2E must cover
  every surface, not just the happy-path one.)
