# CLAUDE.md — SelfOS

Project rules for Claude Code. Read this every session. It is the source of truth for **how**
we build SelfOS; the **what** lives in [`docs/specs/`](docs/specs).

---

## 1. What SelfOS is

SelfOS is an **AI therapist + life coach** desktop app. It is powered by the **Claude API** and
stores everything as plain files the user owns.

### Positioning & safety (non-negotiable)

- SelfOS is a **wellness / self-help** tool. It is **NOT medical**, **NOT a medical device**, and
  **NOT a substitute for professional care**. Never describe it as therapy in the clinical sense,
  diagnosis, or treatment.
- Any feature that touches the user's wellbeing must keep this boundary visible and must route
  crisis/self-harm situations to professional resources (e.g., emergency services, crisis lines)
  rather than attempting to handle them alone. When we build conversational features, this becomes
  a hard requirement with its own spec section.
- Treat all user content as **highly sensitive personal data**. It never leaves the device except
  in explicit Claude API calls the user has consented to. The API key lives **only** in the
  Electron main process and is never logged, committed, or exposed to the renderer.

| Data             | Plain-file **vault**: Markdown (content) + JSON (state/config)         |
| Vault location   | User-chosen folder (local / Dropbox / iCloud / Drive). **No backend.** |
| AI               | Claude API — key in the **main process only**                          |
| Build / package  | electron-vite (dev/build) + electron-builder (distribution)            |
| Styling          | CSS custom properties (design tokens) + CSS Modules                    |

| Validation       | **Zod** — single source of truth; TS types are inferred from schemas   |
| Routing          | React Router                                                           |

| E2E              | Playwright (Electron)                                                  |
| Repo             | pnpm monorepo (`apps/desktop`, `packages/*`)                           |

Defer voice/interaction modality, but never make an architectural choice that precludes it.

## 3. Architecture principles

1. **Feature-module registry.** Each feature is a self-contained module that _registers_ what it
   contributes (nav entry, routes, settings, data schemas). The app shell knows nothing about
   specific features — adding a feature is adding a module, not editing the shell.
2. **Schema-driven everything.** Settings (and content types) are declared as typed, Zod-backed
   definitions; UI and persistence derive from the declaration. Add a setting = add one declaration.
3. **Vault is the only storage.** All file I/O goes through the main-process vault service: atomic
   writes (temp-file + rename), file-watching, sync-conflict detection, per-format schema
   validation + migration. The renderer never touches `fs`.
4. **Hard process boundaries.** `contextIsolation: true`, `sandbox: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`,
   strict CSP, no remote module. Renderer ↔ main only through a **typed IPC layer** (contextBridge
   preload + typed channel contracts). Secrets and network access stay in main.
5. **DRY, typed seams.** Shared types/schemas live in one place and are imported across
   main/preload/renderer. No duplicated shapes; no `any`.

> These are summarized here; the authoritative detail is [`docs/specs/00-architecture.md`](docs/specs/00-architecture.md).

---

## 4. Coding standards

- **TypeScript strict**, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. No `any`; prefer
  `unknown` + narrowing. No non-null `!` to silence the compiler — fix the type.
- **Zod first.** Define a Zod schema, then `z.infer` the type. Validate at every boundary (files,
  IPC, Claude API responses).
- **Named exports** only (no default exports). **One component per file.** Co-locate
  `Component.module.css` next to `Component.tsx`.
- **No magic values.** Colors, spacing, etc. come from design tokens — never hard-coded.
- **Errors are typed and handled**, never swallowed. User-facing failures degrade gracefully.
- **Accessibility is not optional** — semantic HTML, keyboard support, visible focus, sufficient
  contrast.
- Match the style of surrounding code. Keep modules small and cohesive.

---

## 5. Spec-driven workflow

**No feature code without an approved spec in `docs/specs/`.** The spec is written first, reviewed,
and perfected; then code follows it. If implementation reveals the spec is wrong, update the spec in
the same change (see Living docs).

Specs are numbered and inherit [`docs/specs/_TEMPLATE.md`](docs/specs/_TEMPLATE.md).

---

## 6. How we work — the methodical cadence

We move **slowly and deliberately**, perfecting one slice before starting the next.

For every slice:

1. **Branch** off `main` (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…`, `docs/…`). Never commit directly to `main`.
2. **Spec** → review with the user → perfect → approve.
3. **Implement** with tests (see Definition of Done).
4. Run the **`ship-slice`** skill: `quality-gate` → `code-reviewer` agent → `sync-docs` → commit.
5. Confirm Definition of Done, then merge to `main` (locally for now) and move on.

When in doubt, **ask** — never assume or guess. (The user has asked for this explicitly.)

---

## 7. Definition of Done

A slice is **not** done until **all** of these pass:

- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` clean
- [ ] `pnpm lint` clean (ESLint) and Prettier-formatted
- [ ] Unit/component tests for new logic (Vitest); meaningful, not trivial
- [ ] E2E tests for new user-facing flows (Playwright)
- [ ] **Docs in lockstep** — relevant spec / `CLAUDE.md` / skills updated (`sync-docs`)
- [ ] **Self code-review** passed (`code-reviewer` agent); findings fixed or explicitly accepted
- [ ] Accessibility check for any UI
- [ ] **Conventional Commit** on a feature branch

The `quality-gate` skill runs the automatable subset. The git hooks
(`.husky/pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, `pre-push`) and CI enforce the hard gates so they can't be
bypassed.

---

## 8. Living docs & the feedback loop (keep everything up to date)

Docs, rules, and skills must always match reality. Two loops:

- **Reactive — when the user gives feedback or a durable preference:** use the **`capture-feedback`**
  skill to persist it to the right place (this file, a skill, settings, or a spec) and append a dated
  entry to the Changelog below. Don't just remember it for the session — write it down.
- **Proactive — after any change in behavior:** use the **`sync-docs`** skill (backed by the
  `doc-auditor` agent) to detect drift between code and `docs/specs/` / `CLAUDE.md` / skills, and
  propose the concrete edits. The `pre-commit` doc-drift warning is the deterministic backstop.

If you notice a rule here is stale or contradicted by how we actually work, **propose updating it**.

---

## 9. Git & commit standards

- **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`,
  `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, `revert:`). Enforced by commitlint; body lines ≤ 100 chars.
- Every commit ends with the trailer:
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- **Feature branches only**; merge to `main` after review. The **`commit`** skill writes compliant
  messages; it refuses to commit if the quality gate hasn't passed.

## 10. Commands

```bash
pnpm install        # install deps + set up git hooks (husky)
pnpm lint           # ESLint across the monorepo
pnpm lint:fix       # ESLint --fix
pnpm format         # Prettier write
pnpm format:check   # Prettier check
pnpm typecheck      # TypeScript per-package (--if-present)
pnpm test           # Vitest unit/component (delegates to each package)
pnpm test:watch     # Vitest watch

# Desktop app (apps/desktop)
pnpm --filter @selfos/desktop dev     # electron-vite dev (HMR)
pnpm --filter @selfos/desktop build   # build main/preload/renderer to out/
pnpm --filter @selfos/desktop e2e     # build, then Playwright-Electron E2E
```

Tests are **per-package** (`pnpm -r test`): the desktop app runs Vitest with a jsdom environment for
component tests. E2E (Playwright + Electron) runs on demand / in CI, not on every push (it builds the
app first).

## 11. Skills & agents available

**Skills** (`.claude/skills/`): `write-spec`, `quality-gate`, `capture-feedback`, `sync-docs`,
`commit`, `ship-slice`. (`add-setting` and `new-feature-module` are added once the settings registry
and feature-module architecture are built.)

**Agents** (`.claude/agents/`): `code-reviewer`, `test-author`, `spec-writer`, `doc-auditor`.
