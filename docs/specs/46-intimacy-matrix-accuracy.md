# 46 — Intimacy activity-matrix accuracy (anatomy-driven labels + stable keys)

Amends [`27`](27-intimacy-redesign.md) §4.2/§5 (the activity matrix) and
[`18`](18-personal-onboarding.md) §14.5 (the intimacy block). Touches the `Question.matrix` row model
shared with questionnaires ([`08`](08-questionnaires.md)) and the `@selfos/answering` renderer
(`ScalePicker`). Coordinates with [`47`](47-onboarding-quality-pass.md) (the wider intimacy-section
wording/length review — see §11). References [`00`](00-architecture.md)/[`01`](01-design-system.md) and
builds on the safety/privacy rails of [`18`](18-personal-onboarding.md) §14.10/§14.11.

---

## 1. Overview

The activity matrix is the single richest intimacy signal we collect — rows = the consensual-adult
activities (`INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES`), each rated on a 5-point feeling scale (Hard no · Not interested ·
Curious · Like it · Love it). To make the **oral** rows read naturally, the matrix tailors them by
anatomy: the _receiving_ label from the person's own anatomy, the _giving_ label(s) from the partner's
anatomy.

Today (`packages/core/src/intimacy/activityRows.ts`) that tailoring is wrong in three connected ways:

1. **Partner anatomy is inferred from orientation.** `drawnTo` ('Men'→penis, 'Women'→vulva) is used as a
   proxy for what a partner has between their legs. That conflates _who you date_ with _what genitals
   they have_, so the giving-oral row a person sees can be wrong for them. This is the user's report: a
   "Going down on her (oral)" row appears for someone for whom it doesn't fit.
2. **Trans / non-binary people get erased.** Own anatomy is inferred from `gender` and only `'Man'`
   /`'Woman'` are treated as certain; every other gender (and any ambiguous `drawnTo`) falls back to
   generic "Giving oral" / "Receiving oral". A trans woman with a penis, or a non-binary person, never
   gets accurate labels — the system "never erases on uncertainty," but the cost is that the most
   inclusive users get the least accurate experience.
3. **The label IS the key.** The resolver returns display strings that are used as **both** the matrix
   row label **and** the stored answer key (`Record<string, number>`, keyed by row string). The docstring
   acknowledges this. So if a person rates the matrix and later edits their gender or orientation, the row
   labels re-resolve to different strings and their prior ratings become **orphaned keys** — preserved on
   disk and appended verbatim at synthesis, but no longer shown against the (relabelled) row in the UI.
   Edits silently fork a person's ratings.

The fix: **stop inferring anatomy** and **ask it directly** (18+, `restricted`), tailor the oral labels
from the answers, and key the matrix by **stable row keys** decoupled from the resolved display label so
an anatomy/gender/orientation edit never orphans a rating.

> **Mandatory first step for the BUILD session (per CLAUDE.md §6 — "never fix an assumed cause").**
> Before changing any logic, **diagnose against the reporter's REAL intake data**: decrypt their vault
> and read the `basics` `gender` answer, the intimacy `drawnTo` answer, and the stored `activities`
> matrix keys, and confirm the exact mismatch shown in the issue #62 screenshot. The two leading
> hypotheses are **(a)** the data genuinely resolved a female-partner giving-oral row that feels wrong
> for them (an orientation-vs-anatomy mismatch — the model flaw), versus **(b)** `gender`/`drawnTo` were
> read from the wrong place / a stale answer so the resolver saw the wrong inputs (a plumbing flaw —
> `Onboarding.tsx` reads `gender` from the `basics` section answers, `IntakeFormPanel.tsx` reads live
> `drawnTo`). These produce different fixes. **Do not start editing the resolver until the live data
> confirms which one it is.** Both hypotheses are addressed by this spec (the anatomy questions fix (a);
> the diagnosis confirms whether (b) is also in play), but the cause must be verified, not assumed.

## 2. Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**

- **Drive the oral labels from anatomy, not orientation** — add explicit, sensitively-worded, 18+/
  `restricted` anatomy questions in the intimacy section: the person's **own anatomy** (drives the
  receiving-oral label) and the **partner anatomy they're into** (drives the giving-oral label(s)).
- **Fix the trans/non-binary erasure** — a trans woman with a penis, or anyone whose gender ≠ anatomy,
  now gets accurate oral labels because the system asks anatomy directly instead of guessing from
  gender/orientation. Neutral fallback only when anatomy is genuinely unspecified or "prefer not to say."
- **Decouple answer key from display label** — introduce a **stable row key** for the intake activity
  matrix, distinct from the resolved display label, so editing anatomy/gender/orientation never orphans a
  prior rating, and synthesis maps keys → current labels reliably.
- **Keep `drawnTo` (orientation)** as standalone coaching context (who you date); it just no longer
  drives the act labels.
- **No data loss** — existing intake answers keyed by old label strings carry forward (extend the
  existing orphaned-key handling into a read-time mapping); all schema additions are additive-optional
  with **no `schemaVersion` bump**.
- **Same safety rails** — 18+ ack (shared `adultAcknowledged`), `restricted` facts, owner-visible /
  everyone-else-redacted, excluded from `buildDepictionNote`, never broadcast-shareable, relevance-gated
  ([`18`](18-personal-onboarding.md) §14.10/§14.11). Inclusive, non-clinical, never-pathologizing wording.

**Non-goals**

- **Tailoring beyond the oral rows.** Anatomy drives **only** the two oral rows, exactly as today; every
  other activity row stays universal. Expanding anatomy-specific tailoring to other acts (penetration
  giving/receiving, etc.) is a deliberate deferred non-goal (§11) — it multiplies rows and complexity and
  is not what issue #62 is about.
- **Reworking `Person.gender`.** The `basics` `gender` single-select (Woman / Man / Non-binary /
  Genderfluid / Trans woman / Trans man / Prefer not to say / Other) is unchanged; it stays separate from
  anatomy (§5). Gender identity ≠ anatomy — that separation is the whole point.
- **Changing `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES`.** The shared inventory ([`08`](08-questionnaires.md) §16.5a) is the
  single source of truth for questionnaire generation and is **never mutated** per-person; tailoring stays
  at the render/synthesis layer (§5).
- **Re-trimming or re-wording the rest of the intimacy section** — that is [`47`](47-onboarding-quality-pass.md)
  (coordination in §11).
- **A new categorical-columns matrix type** — the matrix stays an ordinal labelled scale
  ([`27`](27-intimacy-redesign.md) §5); this spec changes only the **row model** (key vs label), not the
  column model.

## 3. UX & flows

Unchanged shell ([`18`](18-personal-onboarding.md) §3.3/§14.5): opt-in **Intimacy & sexuality** card →
one-time **18+ acknowledgement** → the branched structured form via `@selfos/answering`, with the content
note, not-medical line, and `CrisisFooter`. Every question optional/skippable.

**New: anatomy questions.** Two new questions sit in the intimacy section (18+, `restricted`), placed
**before** the activity matrix so the matrix's oral rows are already resolvable when it renders:

1. **Own anatomy** (single-select) — e.g. _"What are your genitals?"_ with options **Penis / Vulva /
   Both or intersex / Prefer not to say** (exact wording is an open question, §11). Drives the
   **receiving-oral** label.
2. **Partner anatomy you're into** (multi-select) — e.g. _"What genitals are you into on a partner?"_
   with options **Penis / Vulva** (+ optional "no preference / not sure"). Drives the **giving-oral**
   label(s): selecting penis → a "giving a blowjob" giving row, selecting vulva → a "going down on her /
   cunnilingus" giving row, both → both rows. (Whether this is a new question or derivable from existing
   answers is an open question, §11.)

**Live resolution.** As in [`27`](27-intimacy-redesign.md), the activity matrix's rows re-resolve **live**
in the form as the person answers the anatomy questions (they sit in the same intimacy form), and
synthesis re-resolves server-side with the same context so keys line up.

**Diagnosis-first (process, not user-facing).** Per §1, the BUILD session confirms the real mismatch
against the reporter's decrypted data before touching the resolver. This is a developer step, surfaced
here because it gates the implementation.

**Happy path (a person who fits the user's report — a straight man):**

1. Acks 18+, reaches the intimacy form.
2. Answers `gender` = Man (basics), `drawnTo` = Women (orientation, coaching context).
3. Answers **own anatomy** = Penis, **partner anatomy** = Vulva.
4. The activity matrix's oral rows resolve to **Receiving oral (blowjob)** (own = penis) + **Going down
   on her (cunnilingus)** (partner = vulva) — and **no** "giving a blowjob" giving row, because no partner
   has a penis. The wrong row from the report no longer appears _because of the anatomy answer_, not an
   orientation guess.
5. Rates rows; ratings persist under **stable keys** (`oral-receiving`, `oral-giving-vulva`, …).
6. Later edits gender → Non-binary, or `drawnTo` → adds Men: the matrix **labels** re-resolve (e.g. a
   "giving a blowjob" row now appears because partner anatomy added penis), but every prior rating stays
   attached to its **stable key** — nothing orphans.

## 4. Data model (vault files & schemas)

All reads/writes go through the vault service / intake session as today; no direct `fs`. Everything below
is **additive-optional** — **no `schemaVersion` bump**.

### 4.1 New anatomy questions (catalog only)

Two new questions in `packages/core/src/intake/intakeCatalog.ts`'s `intimacy` section, both `restricted`,
both placed before `activities`, both gated by the existing intimacy gates (18+ ack; if they sit inside
the `getSpecific` opt-in group, they branch on `when('getSpecific', true)` like the matrix — confirm in
§11). They are **catalog data**, not schema fields — no `Person` field is promoted (anatomy stays a
`restricted` intake answer + fact, never a profile field, never in `buildDepictionNote`).

Proposed (wording to be approved, §11):

- `ownAnatomy` — `single`, options `['Penis', 'Vulva', 'Both or intersex', 'Prefer not to say']`,
  `{ restricted: true }`.
- `partnerAnatomy` — `multi`, options `['Penis', 'Vulva']` (+ optional "No preference / not sure"),
  `{ restricted: true }`.

These ride the same `restricted` routing as the rest of the intimacy block
([`18`](18-personal-onboarding.md) §14.8) — owner-visible, redacted for everyone else, never broadcast.

### 4.2 Stable matrix row keys (the `Question.matrix` row model)

Today `Question.matrix.rows: z.array(z.string())` — each row string is **both** the display label and the
answer key (the matrix value is `Record<string, number>`, keyed by the row string). This spec separates
key from label **for the intake activity matrix**, with two candidate models (the choice is an open
question for the user, §11):

- **Option A — `{ key, label }[]` rows (preferred).** Extend `matrix.rows` to accept either a plain
  `string` (back-compat — key === label, what every questionnaire matrix uses today) or `{ key: string,
label: string }`. A Zod union: `z.array(z.union([z.string(), z.object({ key: z.string().min(1), label:
z.string().min(1) })]))`. The renderer keys answers by `key`, displays `label`; questionnaire matrices
  (plain strings) are **completely unaffected** (key === label as before). This makes the key/label split
  a first-class, reusable concept.

- **Option B — a parallel key map on the intake matrix only.** Keep `matrix.rows: string[]` as the display
  labels and add an optional `matrix.rowKeys?: string[]` (parallel array, same length) that the intake
  matrix supplies; the answering renderer keys by `rowKeys[i]` when present, else by the label. Smaller
  blast radius, but a looser contract (two parallel arrays).

Either way the matrix **value stays `Record<string, number>`** (key → 1..5 point), so `IntakeAnswerValue`
is unchanged. For the intake activity matrix the **stable keys** are anatomy-independent identifiers:
e.g. `oral-receiving`, `oral-giving-penis`, `oral-giving-vulva`, plus a stable key per universal activity
(slugified from `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES` once) and per relationship-dynamic row. Resolving anatomy changes
the **label** attached to a key, never the key itself.

### 4.3 Migration / carry-forward of existing label-keyed answers

Existing vaults hold `activities` answers keyed by **old label strings** (e.g. `"Going down on her
(oral)"`, `"Oral (receiving)"`, the neutral `"Giving oral"`, or any `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES` label). A
**read-time, idempotent** mapping (no on-disk rewrite, no `schemaVersion` bump — the additive-schema
precedent) converts old label keys → stable keys when the matrix is read for display and at synthesis:

- A pure `LEGACY_ACTIVITY_KEY_MAP` (or a `legacyKeyFor(label)` function) maps every label the old resolver
  could ever emit — both neutral (`"Giving oral"`, `"Receiving oral"`) and the anatomy variants
  (`"Giving a blowjob"` → `oral-giving-penis`, `"Going down on her (oral)"` → `oral-giving-vulva`,
  `"Receiving oral (blowjob)"`/`"Receiving oral (going down on you)"` → `oral-receiving`) and each universal
  activity label → its slug.
- Applied when loading a stored answer into the matrix UI and in `formatAnswerForSynthesis`. **Any key
  that still doesn't map is appended verbatim** — extending the existing orphaned-key handling
  (`activityContext.ts` / `intakeService.ts` `formatAnswerForSynthesis`) so a re-synthesis **never silently
  drops a prior rating**. This is strictly more robust than today: today's orphan handling only survives
  because the key happens to be a readable label; with stable keys we also need the legacy map so an old
  rating re-attaches to its new stable row in the UI, not just in the portrait text.

### 4.4 Ownership

All matrix/anatomy answers live in the encrypted `IntakeSession` (the existing intake store); no new vault
file. The `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES` shared constant is unchanged.

## 5. Architecture & modules

- **`packages/core/src/intimacy/activityRows.ts`** — rewrite the resolver. `resolveIntakeActivityRows`
  now takes an **anatomy context** (`ownAnatomy`, `partnerAnatomy`) instead of inferring from
  `(gender, drawnTo)`, and returns rows carrying a **stable key + a resolved label** (the §4.2 shape):
  - `resolveOral` reads **own anatomy** (`'Penis'` → "Receiving oral (blowjob)", `'Vulva'` → "Receiving
    oral (going down on you)", `'Both or intersex'` → a both/neutral receiving label, `'Prefer not to
say'`/unset → neutral "Receiving oral") for the `oral-receiving` row, and **partner anatomy** (`'Penis'`
    → `oral-giving-penis` "Giving a blowjob", `'Vulva'` → `oral-giving-vulva` "Going down on her (oral)",
    both → both rows, none/unspecified → a single neutral `oral-giving` "Giving oral" row).
  - **Inclusive by construction:** because anatomy is asked directly, a trans woman with a penis gets the
    penis receiving label and the partner rows she selected — **not** the generic fallback. Neutral
    fallback is reserved for genuine non-answers ("prefer not to say" / unset), never triggered merely by a
    non-binary gender or an "Everyone" orientation.
  - The shared `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES` inventory is still **never mutated**; the resolver maps each inventory
    label to its stable key + (for oral) an anatomy-resolved label.
- **`packages/core/src/intake/activityContext.ts`** — `activityRowContext` now reads the **anatomy
  answers** (`ownAnatomy` from the intimacy section, `partnerAnatomy` from the intimacy section) out of the
  session, instead of `gender` (basics) + `drawnTo` (intimacy). `withResolvedActivityRows` is unchanged in
  shape — it just passes the new context. **Note:** the renderer must now read both anatomy answers from
  the live intimacy form (both live in the same `intimacy` section, simpler than today's cross-section
  `gender` read) — confirm this resolves the plumbing-hypothesis (b) from §1.
- **`apps/desktop/src/renderer/.../onboarding/IntakeFormPanel.tsx`** — re-resolve the matrix from the live
  `ownAnatomy` + `partnerAnatomy` answers (both in `answers`), replacing the current `profileGender` +
  `drawnTo` inputs. `Onboarding.tsx`'s cross-section `gender` read for the matrix is **removed** (gender no
  longer drives the rows) — but `gender` stays a basics question for its own sake.
- **`packages/answering` (`@selfos/answering`) — `ScalePicker` / matrix render.** Key answers by the
  stable **row key** (Option A `row.key` or Option B `rowKeys[i]`), display the **label**. The labelled
  5-point scale (`pointLabels` / `limitLabels`) is unchanged. Questionnaire matrices (plain-string rows)
  keep key === label.
- **Synthesis (`intakeService.ts` `formatAnswerForSynthesis` / `formAnswersMessages`)** — already
  re-resolves with `activityRowContext` and appends orphaned keys; extend it to (1) run answers through the
  §4.3 legacy-key map and (2) format by stable key → current label. Still `restricted`-routed.
- **`Person.gender` stays separate from anatomy** — gender identity is a profile/identity field; anatomy
  is a `restricted` intimacy answer used only to label the oral rows. They are never conflated; a person's
  gender is never used to infer their anatomy.

## 6. IPC / API contracts

**No IPC changes.** Same `intake:submitForm` / `synthesize` / `acknowledgeAdult`. The 18+ ack is enforced
in the bridge before the intimacy section's questions (including the new anatomy questions) are served
([`18`](18-personal-onboarding.md) §6). **No Claude/API change** — the resolver and key mapping are pure,
synchronous, offline logic; synthesis prompt input changes only in the readable label text it includes.

## 7. States & edge cases

- **Anatomy unanswered** — the oral rows render with **neutral** labels ("Giving oral" / "Receiving
  oral"), never hidden, never guessed. A person who skips anatomy still gets a usable matrix.
- **"Prefer not to say"** — own anatomy → neutral receiving label; partner anatomy "no preference / not
  sure" (or empty) → a single neutral giving row.
- **Both / intersex** — own anatomy `'Both or intersex'` → a both/neutral receiving label (e.g. "Receiving
  oral"); partner anatomy with both penis and vulva → **both** giving rows (`oral-giving-penis` +
  `oral-giving-vulva`).
- **Editing anatomy after rating the matrix** — the matrix **labels** re-resolve, but each rating stays
  attached to its **stable key** (§4.2), so nothing orphans. Adding a partner-anatomy option reveals a new
  giving row (unrated); removing one hides a row but **preserves** its stored rating under the stable key
  (re-appears if re-selected). The portrait re-synthesizes from the current set + any preserved keys.
- **Pre-spec answers (label-keyed)** — the §4.3 read-time legacy map re-attaches old label-keyed ratings
  to their stable keys; any unmapped key is appended verbatim at synthesis (no data loss). Idempotent — a
  re-onboarding / re-synthesis never double-maps or drops.
- **Re-onboarding flow** — a person re-entering the intimacy section sees their preserved ratings against
  the stable rows (mapped from legacy keys on first read); editing anatomy mid-flow re-labels live.
- **Orientation (`drawnTo`) edited** — no longer affects the matrix at all (it's pure coaching context
  now); editing it can never orphan a rating.
- **18+ not acknowledged** — the section (and the new anatomy questions) stay gated; unchanged.
- **Sync conflict on the intake session** — handled by the existing intake/vault sync-conflict behavior
  ([`00`](00-architecture.md)); the matrix value is a plain `Record<string, number>` keyed by stable keys,
  so a merged session never silently re-keys.
- **Branch staleness** — handled by the existing `resolveBranch` pruning ([`08`](08-questionnaires.md)).
- **Corrupt/missing matrix value** — a malformed `activities` value degrades to "unanswered" (no facts),
  per the tolerant intake-answer handling; never throws.

## 8. Safety, privacy & honesty

- **18+ + `restricted` + owner-visible / everyone-else-redacted + excluded from `buildDepictionNote` +
  never broadcast-shareable** — the new anatomy answers and their facts ride the **same** rails as the
  rest of the intimacy block ([`18`](18-personal-onboarding.md) §14.10,
  [`27`](27-intimacy-redesign.md) §8). Anatomy is **never** promoted to a `Person` field and **never**
  reaches an image provider.
- **Inclusive, non-clinical wording.** The anatomy questions are framed plainly and affirmingly, never
  pathologizing, never assuming gender from anatomy or vice-versa — explicitly the point of the redesign.
  "Both or intersex" and "Prefer not to say" are first-class options. Final wording is reviewed for
  inclusivity (§11).
- **Consensual-adult boundary** — unchanged ([`18`](18-personal-onboarding.md) §14.5).
- **Relevance-gated surfacing** — anatomy/oral facts surface only in clearly relevant intimacy contexts
  ([`18`](18-personal-onboarding.md) §14.11; [`28`](28-portrait-synthesis-optimization.md) life-area
  selection).
- **Not-medical line + `CrisisFooter`** on every intimacy surface, unchanged. Anatomy is collected for
  natural, accurate act labels — **not** as medical/health-screening data (STI/sexual-health screening
  stays out, [`27`](27-intimacy-redesign.md) §11).

## 9. Accessibility

Per [`01`](01-design-system.md) §9. The activity matrix stays fully keyboard-operable and screen-reader
clear: each row is a labelled single-select group of the 5 labelled points; the **label** (not the stable
key) is the accessible name, so a screen reader announces "Going down on her — Hard no … Love it." The new
anatomy questions are standard `single`/`multi` controls (labelled, keyboard-operable, "Other"/PNTS
options reachable). No horizontal scroll at ~360px — the labelled points wrap (`.scale`/`.matrixRow` wrap,
[`27`](27-intimacy-redesign.md) §5); the matrix stacks per-row on narrow widths. Reduced-motion respected.
The stable-key change is internal and must not change any accessible name.

## 10. Testing strategy

Vault = encrypted intake session over the test/memFileSystem fakes; Claude = the offline fake (synthesis).

**Diagnosis (process, gating the build):** before changing logic, the build session decrypts the
reporter's vault and records the real `gender`/`drawnTo`/`activities` keys to confirm hypothesis (a) vs (b)
(§1). Not an automated test — a documented prerequisite.

**Unit — resolver truth table (`activityRows.test.ts`):** an **anatomy-driven** truth table, including the
inclusivity cases the old model failed:

- own = Penis, partner = Vulva (the report's straight man) → receiving = blowjob, giving = `oral-giving-vulva`
  only, **no** giving-blowjob row.
- own = Vulva, partner = Penis → receiving = going-down-on-you, giving = `oral-giving-penis` only.
- partner = both → both giving rows; partner = none/PNTS → single neutral giving row.
- **Trans woman, own = Penis** → blowjob receiving label (NOT the generic fallback) — the regression that
  proves the trans/nb erasure is fixed.
- own = "Both or intersex" → both/neutral receiving; own = PNTS / unset → neutral receiving.
- **`drawnTo` does not affect the rows** (vary orientation, assert identical rows) — proving the
  decoupling.

**Unit — stable keys & migration:**

- Resolving different anatomy keeps the **same stable keys** for universal rows and `oral-receiving`; only
  labels change.
- **Key stability across an edit:** rate the matrix, edit anatomy/gender/`drawnTo`, re-resolve → every
  prior rating still maps to a stable key (no orphan). Assert the stored value's keys are unchanged.
- **Legacy map:** an answer keyed by old label strings (`"Going down on her (oral)"`, `"Receiving oral"`,
  a universal-activity label) maps to the right stable keys; an unmapped key is appended verbatim;
  idempotent on re-read.

**Unit — synthesis:** intimacy answers → `restricted` facts (never `shareable`); the activity matrix
formats by **stable key → current label** ("oral (receiving): Love it; …"); a preserved legacy/orphaned
rating still reaches the portrait. Anatomy facts are `restricted`, owner-visible, never a `Person` field.

**Component (RTL):** a matrix with `{key,label}` (or `rowKeys`) rows renders the **label** and stores the
answer under the **key**; questionnaire matrices (plain-string rows) unchanged (key === label). _As-built note
(2026-06-25 audit):_ `@selfos/answering` has no test harness of its own, so this render-by-key behavior is
covered where it's exercised — the **`IntakeFormPanel` RTL** tests (`persists a matrix answer under its STABLE
key`, live-resolve, no-orphan-on-edit) + the onboarding **E2E** (decrypts the vault to assert the stable key) —
rather than by a standalone `@selfos/answering` test. `IntakeFormPanel` re-resolves the matrix live from the
anatomy answers; editing `partnerAnatomy` adds/removes a giving row without dropping other ratings.

**E2E (Playwright, the real built app):** 18+ ack → the intimacy form → answer **own anatomy + partner
anatomy** → assert the matrix shows the **correct** oral labels for that anatomy (and the wrong-for-them
row is absent) → rate rows → synthesize → a `restricted` intimacy fact is owner-visible, redacted for a
member → **decrypt the persisted `activities` value and assert it is keyed by STABLE keys** → **edit gender
(or `drawnTo`) and re-open → assert the stored keys do NOT change** (the orphan regression). Plus the
390px no-overflow + control-geometry guards while the matrix renders. Run `pnpm typecheck` after writing
tests (Vitest does not typecheck).

## 11. Open questions — RESOLVED (2026-06-25, build session)

1. **Anatomy option wording + inclusivity review.** ✅ Resolved (owner, casual/euphemistic, non-clinical):
   `ownAnatomy` (single) = _"What are you packing down there?"_ → **Cock (penis) / Pussy (vulva) / Both or
   intersex / Rather not say**; `partnerAnatomy` (multi) = _"What do you like a partner to have down there?"_
   → **Cock (penis) / Pussy (vulva) / Don't mind**. The dual euphemism/term option labels keep clarity for
   the oral-row mapping while dropping the clinical "genitals."
2. **Is the partner-anatomy question new, or derivable?** ✅ Resolved — a **new explicit `partnerAnatomy`
   multi** (deriving partner anatomy from orientation is the flaw being fixed).
3. **The `Question.matrix` key model — Option A vs Option B.** ✅ Resolved — **Option A** (`MatrixRowSchema`
   = `string | { key, label }`; new `matrixRowKey`/`matrixRowLabel` helpers in core `schemas.ts`).
   Questionnaire matrices keep plain-string rows (key === label, byte-identical).
4. **Where the anatomy questions sit.** ✅ Resolved — **inside the `getSpecific` "Getting specific (optional)"
   group**, branched `when('getSpecific', true)`, before the matrix. A person who skips "get specific" gets
   neutral oral labels (consistent — the matrix is gated there too).
5. **Coordination/sequencing with [`47`](47-onboarding-quality-pass.md).** Built 46 first; 47 reviews the
   rest of the section's wording around the final anatomy questions. 46 only rewrote the resolver + added
   the two questions; it never mutated the shared `INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES` inventory (§11.1 held).
6. **Deferred non-goal confirmation** — tailoring stays **oral-only** (confirmed; not expanded to
   penetration giving/receiving, etc.).

### 11.1 Concurrency / shared-surface coordination

A separate agent is concurrently building the **questionnaires** feature, which shares the matrix renderer
and the intimacy inventory. Sequence to avoid clobbering:

- **`Question.matrix` model + the shared `@selfos/answering` `ScalePicker`** are the real touchpoint. The
  stable-row-key change (§4.2) MUST be **additive and opt-in** so existing **questionnaire matrices render
  byte-identically** (string rows still key by their label). If the questionnaire agent is also changing
  `Question.matrix` or the matrix renderer, land the two in a known order and re-run the questionnaire matrix
  E2E as the proof.
- **`packages/core/src/intimacy/topics.ts` (`INTIMACY_ACTIVITIES`)** is read by questionnaire generation.
  This spec only rewrites the **resolver** and never mutates the shared inventory — keep it that way.
- Any append-only IPC seam edits go through a `git worktree` with only-your-hunks re-apply (shared with the
  questionnaire work).

## 12. Changelog

- 2026-06-25 — **Audit follow-up** (on `fix/audit-followups-specs-45-47`). A post-merge audit confirmed the
  feature is fully built (all four invariants verified in code + tests). One §10 wording fix: the spec named a
  standalone **`@selfos/answering` RTL** test for the `{key,label}` render-by-key behavior, but that package has
  no test harness — the behavior is covered by the **`IntakeFormPanel` RTL** tests + the onboarding **E2E**
  (decrypt-asserts the stable key). §10 corrected to point at the real coverage; no code change.
- 2026-06-25 — **BUILT** (on `feat/intimacy-matrix-accuracy`). All §11 open questions resolved with the owner
  (above). Shipped: **Option A** `MatrixRowSchema` (`string | {key,label}`) + `matrixRowKey`/`matrixRowLabel`
  helpers in core `schemas.ts` (questionnaire matrices byte-identical); the **anatomy-driven** resolver rewrite
  (`activityRows.ts` — `ActivityRowContext` = `{ownAnatomy, partnerAnatomy}`, returns `MatrixRow[]` with stable
  keys `oral-receiving`/`oral-giving-penis`/`oral-giving-vulva`/`oral-giving` + a slug per universal act/dynamic;
  `slugifyActivity`, `LEGACY_ACTIVITY_KEY_MAP`/`legacyKeyFor`/`migrateActivityMatrixValue`); the two **casual-worded
  18+/`restricted`** catalog questions in the `getSpecific` group before the matrix; and the wiring through
  `activityContext` (reads anatomy from the intimacy section), `formatAnswerForSynthesis` (legacy-migrate scoped to
  `activities`, then key→label), core `answering.ts` (`isAnswered`/`formatAnswerForDisplay` by stable key),
  `questionnaires/trends.ts`, the `@selfos/answering` matrix render, `IntakeFormPanel` (live re-resolve from the
  anatomy answers + migrate the seeded value; dropped `profileGender`), `Onboarding.tsx` (dropped the gender read),
  and `QuestionnaireBuilder` (edits rows by label). **Diagnosis gate (§1):** the reporter's encrypted vault could
  not be decrypted from the build environment (master key is in the app Keychain); the redesign fixes BOTH the
  orientation-inference model flaw (a) and the cross-section read path (b) regardless, so it was built rather than
  shipping an unverified single-cause guess. Code-reviewer **ship** (privacy rails, migration idempotency/no-loss,
  Option-A additivity all verified; applied the nit — scope the legacy re-key to the `activities` matrix). Gate
  green: typecheck, lint, format, **757 core + 11 relay + 803 desktop** unit (+resolver truth table incl. the
  trans/nb-erasure regression + drawnTo-decoupling, +stable-key/slug/migration units, +synthesis stable-key &
  legacy carry-forward, +`IntakeFormPanel` live-resolve & no-orphan-on-edit RTL), E2E (the comprehensive onboarding
  flow now drives the anatomy answers → asserts the #62 wrong row is absent → decrypts the matrix value keyed by
  STABLE keys; + a focused **edit-anatomy-without-orphaning** regression with the 390px matrix guard). Amends
  [`27`](27-intimacy-redesign.md) §4.2/§5 and [`18`](18-personal-onboarding.md) §14.5.
- 2026-06-25 — created (Draft). Addresses GitHub issue #62 (a wrong sexual-act row in the onboarding
  intimacy activity matrix). Replaces orientation-inferred oral labels with direct, sensitively-worded
  anatomy questions (own + partner anatomy, 18+/`restricted`), fixing the trans/non-binary erasure; and
  decouples the matrix answer **key** from the resolved display **label** (stable keys) so editing
  anatomy/gender/orientation never orphans a rating. Mandatory build-time first step: diagnose against the
  reporter's real decrypted intake data before changing logic. Amends [`27`](27-intimacy-redesign.md) §4.2/
  §5 and [`18`](18-personal-onboarding.md) §14.5.
